He wasone of this country's most distinguished trial lawyers. He was alsoa man who was as well known for the three-thousand-dollar Italiansuits which draped his well-fed frame as for his remarkable stringof legal victories. I simply stood there, paralyzed by the shock ofwhat I had just witnessed. The great Julian Mantle had beenreduced to a victim and was now squirming on the ground like ahelpless infant, shaking and shivering and sweating like a maniac.     Everything seemed to move in slow motion from that point on.\"My God, Julian's in trouble!\" his paralegal screamed, emotionallyoffering us a blinding glimpse of the obvious. The judge lookedpanic-stricken and quickly muttered something into the privatephone she had had installed in the event of an emergency. As forme, I could only stand there, dazed and confused. Please don't die,you old fool. Its too early for you to check out. You don't deserveto die like this.     The bailiff, who earlier had looked as if he had been embalmedin his standing position, leapt into action and started to performCPR on the fallen legal hero. The paralegal was at his side, herlong blond curls dangling over Julian's ruby-red face, offering himsoft words of comfort, words which he obviously could not hear.     I had known Julian for seventeen years. We had first met whenI was a young law student hired by one of his partners as a summerresearch intern. Back then, he'd had it all. He was a brilliant, hand-some and fearless trial attorney with dreams of greatness. Julianwas the firm's young star, the rain-maker in waiting. I can stillremember walking by his regal corner office while I was workinglate one night and stealing a glimpse of the framed quotationperched on his massive oak desk. It was by Winston Churchill andit spoke volumes about the man that Julian was:    Sure I am that this day we are masters of our fate, that the    task which has been set before us is not above our strength;    that its pangs and toils are not beyond my endurance. As    long as we have faith in our own cause and an uncon-    querable will to win, victory will not be denied us.    Julian also walked his talk. He was tough, hard-driving andwilling to work eighteen-hour days for the success he believed washis destiny. I heard through the grapevine that his grandfatherhad been a prominent senator and his father a highly respectedjudge of the Federal Court. It was obvious that he came frommoney and that there were enormous expectations weighing on hisArmani-clad shoulders. I'll admit one thing though: he ran his ownrace. He was determined to do things his own way — and he lovedto put on a show.   Julian's outrageous courtroom theatrics regularly made the frontpages of the newspapers. The rich and famous flocked to his sidewhenever they needed a superb legal tactician with an aggressiveedge. His extra-curricular activities were probably as well known.Late-night visits to the city's finest restaurants with sexy young fash-ion models, or reckless drinking escapades with the rowdy band ofbrokers he called his \"demolition team\" became the stuff of legend atthe firm.     I still can't figure out why he picked me to work with him onthat sensational murder case he was to argue that first summer.Though I had graduated from Harvard Law School, his almamater, I certainly wasn't the brightest intern at the firm, and myfamily pedigree reflected no blue blood. My father spent his wholelife as a security guard with a local bank after a stint in theMarines. My mother grew up unceremoniously in the Bronx.     Yet he did pick me over all the others who had been quietlylobbying him for the privilege of being his legal gofer on whatbecame known as \"the Mother of All Murder Trials\": he said heliked my \"hunger.\" We won, of course, and the business executivewho had been charged with brutally killing his wife was now a freeman — or as free as his cluttered conscience would let him be.     My own education that summer was a rich one. It was farmore than a lesson on how to raise a reasonable doubt where noneexisted — any lawyer worth his salt could do that. This was alesson in the psychology of winning and a rare opportunity towatch a master in action. I soaked it up like a sponge.     At Julian's invitation, I stayed on at the firm as an associate,and a lasting friendship quickly developed between us. I willadmit that; he wasn't the easiest lawyer to work with. Serving ashis junior was often an exercise in frustration, leading to morethan a few late-night shouting matches. It was truly his way or thehighway. This man could never be wrong. However, beneath hiscrusty exterior was a person who clearly cared about people.    No matter how busy he was, he would always ask about Jenny,the woman I still call \"my bride\" even though we were marriedbefore I went to law school. On finding out from another summerintern that I was in a financial squeeze, Julian arranged for me toreceive a generous scholarship. Sure, he could play hardball withthe best of them, and sure, he loved to have a wild time, but henever neglected his friends. The real problem was that Julian wasobsessed with work.    For the first few years he justified his long hours by saying thathe was \"doing it for the good of the firm\", and that he planned totake a month off and go to the Caymans \"next winter for sure.\" Astime passed, however, Julian's reputation for brilliance spread andhis workload continued to increase. The cases just kept on gettingbigger and better, and Julian, never one to back down from a goodchallenge, continued to push himself harder and harder. In his raremoments of quiet, he confided that he could no longer sleep formore than a couple of hours without waking up feeling guilty thathe was not working on a file. It soon became clear to me that he wasbeing consumed by the hunger for more: more prestige, more gloryand more money.    As expected, Julian became enormously successful. Heachieved everything most people could ever want: a stellar profes-sional reputation with an income in seven figures, a spectacularmansion in a neighborhood favored by celebrities, a private jet, asummer home on a tropical island and his prized possession — ashiny red Ferrari parked in the center of his driveway.    Yet I knew that things were not as idyllic as they appeared onthe surface. I observed the signs of impending doom not because Iwas so much more perceptive than the others at the firm, butsimply because I spent the most time with the man. We werealways together because we were always at work. Things neverseemed to slow down. There was always another blockbuster caseon the horizon that was bigger than the last. No amount of prepa-ration was ever enough for Julian. What would happen if thejudge brought up this question or that question, God forbid? Whatwould happen if our research was less than perfect? What wouldhappen if he was surprised in the middle of a packed courtroom,looking like a deer caught in the glare of an intruding pair of head-lights? So we pushed ourselves to the limit and I got sucked intohis little work-centered world as well. There we were, two slavesto the clock, toiling away on the sixty-fourth floor of some steel andglass monolith while most sane people were at home with theirfamilies, thinking we had the world by the tail, blinded by an illu-sory version of success.     The more time I spent with Julian, the more I could see thathe was driving himself deeper into the ground. It was as if he hadsome kind of a death wish. Nothing ever satisfied him. Eventually,his marriage failed, he no longer spoke with his father, and thoughhe had every material possession anyone could want, he still hadnot found whatever it was that he was looking for. Itshowed, emotionally, physically — and spiritually.     At fifty-three years of age, Julian looked as if he was in hislate seventies. His face was a mass of wrinkles, a less than glori-ous tribute to his \"take no prisoners\" approach to life in generaland the tremendous stress of his out-of-balance lifestyle in partic-ular. The late-night dinners in expensive French restaurants,smoking thick Cuban cigars and drinking cognac after cognac,had left him embarrassingly overweight. He constantlycomplained that he was sick and tired of being sick and tired. Hehad lost his sense of humor and never seemed to laugh anymore.Julian's once enthusiastic nature had been replaced by a deathlysomberness. Personally, I think that his life had lost all sense ofpurpose.     Perhaps the saddest thing was that he had also lost his focus inthe courtroom. Where he would once dazzle all those present withan eloquent and airtight closing argument, he now droned on forhours, rambling about obscure cases that had little or no bearingon the matter before the Court. Where once he would react grace-fully to the objections of opposing counsel, he now displayed abiting sarcasm that severely tested the patience of judges who hadearlier viewed him as a legal genius. Simply put, Julian's spark oflife had begun to flicker.     It wasn't just the strain of his frenetic pace that was markinghim for an early grave. I sensed it went far deeper. It seemed tobe a spiritual thing. Almost every day he would tell me that he feltno passion for what he was doing and was enveloped by emptiness.Julian said that as a young lawyer, he really loved the Law, eventhough he was initially pushed into it by the social agenda of hisfamily. The Law's complexities and intellectual challenges hadkept him spellbound and full of energy. Its power to effect socialchange had inspired and motivated him. Back then, he was morethan just some rich kid from Connecticut. He really saw himselfas a force for good, an instrument for social improvement whocould use his obvious gifts to help others. That vision gave his lifemeaning. It gave him a purpose and it fuelled his hopes.     There was even more to Julian's undoing than a rustyconnection to what he did for a living. He had suffered somegreat tragedy before I had joined the firm. Something trulyunspeakable had happened to him, according to one of the seniorpartners, but I couldn't get anyone to open up about it. Even oldman Harding, the notoriously loose-lipped managing partnerwho spent more time in the bar of the Ritz-Carlton than in hisembarrassingly large office, said that he was sworn to secrecy.Whatever this deep, dark secret was, I had a suspicion that it, insome way, was contributing to Julian's downward spiral. Sure Iwas curious, but most of all, I wanted to help him. He was notonly my mentor; he was my best friend.    And then it happened. This massive heart attack that broughtthe brilliant Julian Mantle back down to earth and reconnectedhim to his mortality. Right in the middle of courtroom numberseven on a Monday morning, the same courtroom where we hadwon the Mother of All Murder Trials.                           CHAPTER TWO          The Mysterious VisitorIt was an emergency meeting of all of the firm's members. As wesqueezed into the main boardroom, I could tell that there was aserious problem. Old man Harding was the first to speak to theassembled mass.     \"I'm afraid I have some very bad news. Julian Mantle suffereda severe heart attack in court yesterday while he was arguing theAir Atlantic case. He is currently in the intensive care unit, but hisphysicians have informed me that his condition has now stabilizedand he will recover. However, Julian has made a decision, one thatI think you all must know. He has decided to leave our family andto give up his law practice. He will not be returning to the firm.\"     I was shocked. I knew he was having his share of troubles, butI never thought he would quit As well, after all that we had beenthrough, I thought he should have had the courtesy to tell me thispersonally. He wouldn't even let me see him at the hospital. Everytime I dropped by, the nurses had been instructed to tell me thathe was sleeping and could not be disturbed. He even refused to takemy telephone calls. Maybe I reminded him of the life he wanted toforget Who knows? I'll tell you one thing though. It hurt.     That whole episode was just over three years ago. Last Iheard, Julian had headed off to India on some kind of an expedi-tion. He told one of the partners that he wanted to simplify hislife and that he \"needed some answers\", and hoped he would findthem in that mystical land. He had sold his mansion, his planeand his private island. He had even sold his Ferrari. \"JulianMantle as an Indian yogi,\" I thought. \"The Law works in themost mysterious of ways.\"    As those three years passed, I changed from an overworkedyoung lawyer to a jaded, somewhat cynical older lawyer. My wifeJenny and I had a family. Eventually, I began my own search formeaning. I think it was having kids that did it. They fundamentallychanged the way I saw the world and my role in it. My dad said itbest when he said, \"John, on your deathbed you will never wishyou spent more time at the office.\" So I started spending a littlemore time at home. I settled into a pretty good, if ordinary, exis-tence. I joined the Rotary Club and played golf on Saturdays tokeep my partners and clients happy. But I must tell you, in myquiet moments I often thought of Julian and wondered what hadbecome of him in the years since we had unexpectedly partedcompany.     Perhaps he had settled down in India, a place so diverse thateven a restless soul like his could have made it his home. Or maybehe was trekking through Nepal? Scuba diving off the Caymans?One thing was certain: he had not returned to the legal profession.No one had received even a postcard from him since he left for hisself-imposed exile from the Law.    A knock on my door about two months ago offered the firstanswers to some of my questions. I had just met with my lastclient of a gruelling day when Genevieve, my brainy legalassistant, popped her head into my small, elegantly furnishedoffice.    \"There's someone here to see you, John. He says it's urgentand that he will not leave until he speaks with you.\"     \"I'm on my way out the door, Genevieve,\" I replied impatiently.\"I'm going to grab a bite to eat before finishing off the Hamiltonbrief. I don't have time to see anyone right now. Tell him to makean appointment like everyone else, and call security if he gives youany more trouble.\"     \"But he says he really needs to see you. He refuses to take nofor an answer!\"     For an instant I considered calling security myself, but,realizing that this might be someone in need, I assumed a moreforgiving posture.    \"Okay, send him in\" I retreated. \"I probably could use the busi-ness anyway.\"     The door to my office opened slowly. At last it swung fullyopen, revealing a smiling man in his mid-thirties. He was tall, leanand muscular, radiating an abundance of vitality and energy. Hereminded me of those perfect kids I went to law school with, fromperfect families, with perfect houses, perfect cars and perfect skin.But there was more to my visitor than his youthful good looks. Anunderlying peacefulness gave him an almost divine presence. Andhis eyes. Piercing blue eyes that sliced clear through me like arazor meeting the supple flesh of a fresh-faced adolescent anxiousabout his first shave.    'Another hotshot lawyer gunning for my job,' I thought to myself.'Good grief, why is he just standing there looking at me? I hope thatwasn't his wife I represented on that big divorce case I won last week.Maybe calling security wasn't such a silly idea after all.'    The young man continued to look at me, much as the smilingBuddha might have looked upon a favored pupil. After a longmoment of uncomfortable silence he spoke in a surprisinglycommanding tone.    \"Is this how you treat all of your visitors, John, even those whotaught you everything you know about the science of success in acourtroom? I should have kept my trade secrets to myself,\" hesaid, his full lips curving into a mighty grin.    A strange sensation tickled the pit of my stomach. I immedi-ately recognized that raspy, honey-smooth voice. My heart startedto pound.    \"Julian? Is that you? I can't believe it! Is that really you?\"    The loud laugh of the visitor confirmed my suspicions. Theyoung man standing before me was none other than that long-lostyogi of India: Julian Mantle. I was dazzled by his incredible trans-formation. Gone was the ghost-like complexion, the sickly coughand the lifeless eyes of my former colleague. Gone was the elderlyappearance and the morbid expression that had become hispersonal trademark. Instead, the man in front of me appeared tobe in peak health, his lineless face glowing radiantly. His eyes werebright, offering a window into his extraordinary vitality. Perhapseven more astounding was the serenity that Julian exuded. I feltentirely peaceful just sitting there, staring at him. He was nolonger an anxious, \"type-A\" senior partner of a leading law firm.Instead, the man before me was a youthful, vital — and smiling—model of change.                         CHAPTER THREE        The MiraculousTransformation of Julian MantleI was astonished by the new and improved Julian Mantle.    'How could someone who looked like a tired old man only afew short years ago now look so vibrant and alive?' I wondered insilent disbelief. 'Was it some magical drug that had allowed him todrink from the fountain of youth? What was the cause of thisextraordinary reversal?'    Julian was the first to speak. He told me that the hyper-competitive legal world had taken its toll on him, not only physi-cally and emotionally but spiritually. The fast pace and endlessdemands had worn him out and run him down. He admitted thathis body had fallen apart and that his mind had lost its lustre. Hisheart attack was only one symptom of a deeper problem. Theconstant pressure and exhausting schedule of a world-class triallawyer had also broken his most important—and perhaps mosthuman—endowment: his spirit. When given the ultimatum by hisdoctor either to give up the Law or give up his life, he said he sawa golden opportunity to rekindle the inner fire he had knownwhen he was younger, a fire that had been extinguished as theLaw became less a pleasure and more a business.    Julian grew visibly excited as he recounted how he sold all hismaterial possessions and headed for India, a land whose ancientculture and mystical traditions had always fascinated him. Hetravelled from tiny village to tiny village, sometimes by foot, some-times by train, learning new customs, seeing the timeless sightsand growing to love the Indian people who radiated warmth, kind-ness and a refreshing perspective on the true meaning of life.Even those who had very little opened their homes — and theirhearts — to this weary visitor from the West. As the days meltedinto weeks within this enchanting environment, Julian slowlybegan to feel alive and whole again, perhaps for the first time sincehe was a child. His natural curiosity and creative spark steadilyreturned, along with his enthusiasm and his energy for living. Hestarted to feel more joyful and peaceful. And he began to laughagain.    Although he embraced every moment of his time in this exoticland, Julian told me that his journey to India was more than asimple vacation to ease an overworked mind. He described histime in this far-away land as a \"personal odyssey of the self\". Heconfided that he was determined to find out who he really was andwhat his life was all about before it was too late. To do this, his firstpriority was to connect to that culture's vast pool of ancientwisdom on living a more rewarding, fulfilling and enlightened life.    \"I don't mean to sound too off-the-wall, John, but it was like Ihad received a command from within, an inner instruction tellingme that I was to begin a spiritual voyage to rekindle the spark thatI had lost,\" said Julian. \"It was a tremendously liberating time forme.\"    The more he explored, the more he heard of Indian monkswho had lived beyond the age of a hundred, monks who despitetheir advanced years maintained youthful, energetic and vitallives. The more he travelled, the more he learned of ageless yogiswho had mastered the art of mind-control and spiritual awakening.And the more he saw, the more he longed to understand thedynamics behind these miracles of human nature, hoping to applytheir philosophies to his own life.     During the early stages of his journey, Julian sought outmany well-known and highly respected teachers. He told me thateach one of them welcomed him with open arms and open hearts,sharing whatever gems of knowledge they had absorbed overlifetimes spent in quiet contemplation on the loftier issuessurrounding their existence. Julian also attempted to describethe beauty of the ancient temples which were strewn across themystical landscape of India, edifices which stood as loyal gate-keepers to the wisdom of the ages. He said he was moved by thesacredness of these surroundings.     \"It was a very magical time of my life, John. Here I was, a tiredold litigator who had sold everything from my racehorse to myRolex, and had packed all that remained into a large rucksack thatwould be my constant companion as I ventured into the timelesstraditions of the East.\"     \"Was it hard to leave?\" I wondered aloud, unable to contain mycuriosity.     \"Actually, it was the easiest thing I have ever done. The decisionto give up my practice and all my worldly possessions felt natural.Albert Camus once said that 'Real generosity toward the futureconsists in giving all to what is present.' Well, that's exactly what Idid. I knew I had to change—so I decided to listen to my heart anddo it in a very dramatic way. My life became so much simpler andmeaningful when I left the baggage of my past behind. Themoment I stopped spending so much time chasing the big pleasuresof life, I began to enjoy the little ones, like watching the stars danc-ing in a moonlit sky or soaking in the the sunbeams of a glorioussummer morning. And India is such an intellectually stimulatingplace that I rarely thought of all I had left.\"     Those initial meetings with the learned and the scholarly ofthat exotic culture, though intriguing, did not yield the knowledgefor which Julian hungered. The wisdom that he desired and thepractical techniques that he hoped would change the quality of hislife continued to elude him in those early days of his odyssey. Itwas not until Julian had been in India for about seven months thathe had his first real break.    It was while he was in Kashmir, an ancient and mystical statethat sits sleepily at the foot of the Himalayas, that he had the goodfortune to meet a gentleman named Yogi Krishnan. This slightman with a clean-shaven head had also been a lawyer in his \"previ-ous incarnation,\" as he often joked with a toothy grin. Fed up withwith the hectic pace that personifies modern New Delhi, he toogave up his material possessions and retreated to a world ofgreater simplicity. Becoming a caretaker of the village temple,Krishnan said he had come to know himself and his purpose in thelarger scheme of life.     \"I was tired of living my life like one long air raid drill. Irealized that my mission is to serve others and somehow tocontribute to making this world a better place. Now I live togive,\" he told Julian. \"I spend my days and nights at this temple,living an austere but fulfilling life. I share my realizations withall those who come here to pray. I serve those in need. I am nota priest. I am simply a man who has found his soul.\"     Julian informed this lawyer turned yogi of his own story. Hespoke of his former life of prominence and privilege. He told YogiKrishnan of his hunger for wealth and his obsession with work. Herevealed, with great emotion, his inner turmoil and the crisis ofspirit he had experienced when the once bright light of his lifebegan to flicker in the winds of an out-of-balance lifestyle.    \"I too have walked this path, my friend. I too have felt the painyou have felt. Yet I have learned that everything happens for areason,\" offered Yogi Krishnan sympathetically. \"Every event hasa purpose and every setback its lesson. I have realized that failure,whether of the personal, professional or even spiritual kind, isessential to personal expansion. It brings inner growth and awhole host of psychic rewards. Never regret your past. Rather,embrace it as the teacher that it is.\"    After hearing these words, Julian told me that he felt greatexultation. Perhaps, in Yogi Krishnan, he had found the mentor hewas searching for. Who better than another former hotshotlawyer who, through his own spiritual odyssey, had found a betterway of living to teach him the secrets of creating a life of morebalance, enchantment and delight?     \"I need your help, Krishnan. I need to learn how to build aricher, fuller life.\"     \"I would be honored to assist you in any way that I can,\"offered the yogi. \"But may I give you one suggestion?\"     \"Sure.\"     \"For as long as I have been caring for this temple in this littlevillage, I have heard whisperings of a mystical band of sagesliving high in the Himalayas. Legend has it that they have discov-ered some sort of system that will profoundly improve the qualityof anyone's life — and I don't just mean physically. It is supposedto be a holistic, integrated set of ageless principles and timelesstechniques to liberate the potential of the mind, body and soul.\"    Julian was fascinated. This seemed perfect.    \"Just exactly where do these monks live?\"    \"No one knows, and I regret that I'm too old to start search-ing. But I will tell you one thing, my friend; many have tried to findthem and many have failed — with tragic consequences. Thehigher reaches of the Himalayas are treacherous beyond compare.Even the most skilled climber is rendered helpless against theirnatural ravages. But if it is the golden keys to radiant health, last-ing happiness and inner fulfillment that you are searching for, I donot have the wisdom you seek — they do.\"    Julian, never one to give up easily, pressed Yogi Krishnanagain. \"Are you certain that you have no idea where they live?\"    \"All I can tell you is that the locals in this village know them asthe Great Sages of Sivana. In their mythology, Sivana means 'oasisof enlightenment'. These monks are revered as if they are divinein their constitution and influence. If I knew where they could befound, I would be duty-bound to tell you. But honestly, I do notknow — no one does, for that matter.\"    The next morning, as the first rays of the Indian sun dancedalong the colorful horizon, Julian set out on his trek to the lostland of Sivana. At first he thought about hiring a Sherpa guide toaid him in his climb through the mountains, but, for somestrange reason, his instincts told him that this was one journeyhe would have to make alone. So instead, for perhaps the firsttime in his life, he shed the shackles of reason and placed histrust in his intuition. He felt he would be safe. He somehow knewhe would find what he was looking for. So, with missionary zeal,he started to climb.    The first few days were easy. Sometimes he would catch up toone of the cheerful citizens of the village below who happened to bewalking on one of the footpaths, perhaps searching for just theright piece of wood for a carving or seeking the sanctuary that thissurreal place offered to all those who dared to venture this highinto the Heavens. At other times he hiked alone, using this time tosilently reflect on where he had been in his life — and where hewas now headed.    It didn't take long before the village below was nothing morethan a tiny speck on this marvellous canvas of natural splendor.The majesty of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas made hisheart beat faster and, for one long moment, took his breath away.He felt a oneness with his surroundings, a kind of kinship that twoold friends might enjoy after many years spent listening to eachother's innermost thoughts and laughing at each other's jokes.The fresh mountain air cleared his mind and energized his spirit.Having travelled the world many times over, Julian had thought hehad seen it all. But he had never seen beauty like this. Thewonders of which he drank at that magical time were an exquisitetribute to the symphony of nature. At once he felt joyous, exhila-rated and carefree. It was here, high above the humanity below,that Julian slowly ventured out of the cocoon of the ordinary andbegan to explore the realm of the extraordinary.    \"I still remember the words that were going through my mindup there,\" said Julian. \"I thought that, ultimately, life is all aboutchoices. One's destiny unfolds according to the choices one makes,and I felt certain that the choice I had made was the right one. Iknew my life would never be the same and that something marvel-lous, maybe even miraculous, was about to happen to me. It was anamazing awakening.\"    As Julian climbed into the rarified regions of the Himalayas,he told me that he grew anxious. \"But it was those good kind ofjitters, like the ones I had on prom night or right before an excit-ing case began and the media was chasing me up the courtroomsteps. And even though I didn't have the benefit of a guide or amap, the way was clear and a thin, lightly travelled path led mehigher into the deepest reaches of those mountains. It was like Ihad some sort of inner compass, nudging me gently towards mydestination. I don't think I could have stopped climbing even if Ihad wanted to,\" Julian was excited, his words spilling out like agushing mountain stream after the rains.     As he travelled for two more days along the route that heprayed would take him to Sivana, Julian's thoughts wanderedback to his former life. Though he felt entirely liberated from thestress and strain that personified his former world, he did wonderwhether he could really spend the rest of his days without theintellectual challenge that the legal profession had offered himsince he left Harvard Law School. His thoughts then wanderedback to his oak-paneled office in a glittering downtown skyscraperand the idyllic summer home he had sold for a pittance. Hethought about his old friends with whom he would frequent thefinest of restaurants in the most glamorous locales. He alsothought about his prized Ferrari and how his heart would soarwhen he gunned the engine and all its ferocity sprang to life witha roar.     As he ventured deeper into the depths of this mystical place,his reflections of the past were quickly interrupted by the stun-ning marvels of the moment. It was while he was soaking in thegifts of nature's intelligence that something startling happened.     From the corner of his eye he saw another figure, dressedstrangely in a long, flowing red robe topped by a dark blue hood,slightly ahead of him on the path. Julian was astonished to seeanyone at this isolated spot that had taken him seven treacherousdays to reach. As he was many miles away from any real civiliza-tion and still uncertain as to where his ultimate destination ofSivana could be found, he yelled out to his fellow traveller.    The figure refused to respond and accelerated his pace alongthe path they were both climbing, not even giving Julian the cour-tesy of a backward glance of acknowledgement. Soon the mysteri-ous traveller was running, his red robe dancing gracefully behindhim like crisp cotton sheets hanging from a clothesline on a windyautumn day.    \"Please friend, I need your help to find Sivana,\" yelled Julian,\"I've been travelling for seven days with little food and water. Ithink I'm lost!\"    The figure came to an abrupt stop. Julian approachedcautiously while the traveller stood remarkably still and silent. Hishead did not move, his hands did not move and his feet kept theirplace. Julian could see nothing of the face beneath the hood butwas struck by the contents of the small basket in the hands of thetraveller. Within the basket was a collection of the most delicateand beautiful flowers Julian had ever seen. The figure clutched thebasket tighter as Julian drew nearer, as if to display both a love ofthese prized possessions and a distrust of this tall Westerner,about as common to these parts as dew in the desert.    Julian gazed at the traveller with an intense curiosity. A quickburst of a sunbeam revealed that it was a man's face under theloosely-fitting hood. But Julian had never seen a man quite likethis one. Though he was at least his own age, there were very strik-ing features of this person which left Julian mesmerized and causedhim to simply stop and stare for what seemed like an eternity. Hiseyes were catlike and so penetrating that Julian was forced to lookaway. His olive-complexioned skin was supple and smooth. Hisbody looked strong and powerful. And though the man's handsgave away the fact that he was not young, he radiated such anabundance of youthfulness and vitality that Julian felt hypnotizedby what appeared before him, much like a child watching themagician at his first magic show.     'This must be one of the Great Sages of Sivana,' Julian thoughtto himself, scarcely able to contain his delight at his discovery.     \"I am Julian Mantle. I've come to learn from the Sages ofSivana. Do you know where I might find them?\" he asked.     The man looked thoughtfully at this weary visitor from theWest. His serenity and peace made him appear angelic in nature,enlightened in substance.     The man spoke softly, almost in a whisper, \"Why is it that youseek these sages, friend?\"     Sensing that he had indeed found one of the mystical monkswho had eluded so many before him, Julian opened his heart andpoured out his odyssey to the traveller. He spoke of his former lifeand of the crisis of spirit he had struggled with, how he had tradedhis health and his energy for the fleeting rewards that his lawpractice brought him. He spoke of how he had traded the riches ofhis soul for a fat bank account and the illusory gratification of his'live fast, die young' lifestyle. And he told him of his travels inmystical India and of his meeting with Yogi Krishnan, the formertrial lawyer from New Delhi who had also given up his former lifein the hope of finding inner harmony and lasting peace.     The traveller remained silent and still. It was not until Julianspoke of his burning, almost obsessive desire to acquire theancient principles of enlightened living that the man spoke again.Placing an arm on Julian's shoulder, the man said gently: \"if youtruly have a heartfelt desire to learn the wisdom of a better way,then it is my duty to help you. I am indeed one of those sages thatyou have come so far in search of. You are the first person to findus in many years. Congratulations. I admire your tenacity. Youmust have been quite a lawyer,\" he offered.    He paused, as if he was a little uncertain of what to do next,and then went on. \"If you like, you may come with me, as my guest,to our temple. It rests in a hidden part of this mountain region, stillmany hours away from here. My brothers and sisters will welcomeyou with open arms. We will work together to teach you theancient principles and strategies that our ancestors have passeddown through the ages.    \"Before I take you into our private world and share ourcollected knowledge for filling your life with more joy, strength andpurpose, I must request one promise from you,\" requested thesage. \"Upon learning these timeless truths you must return toyour homeland in the West and share this wisdom with all thosewho need to hear it. Though we are isolated here in these magicalmountains, we are aware of the turmoil your world is in. Goodpeople are losing their way. You must give them the hope that theydeserve. More importantly, you must give them the tools to fulfilltheir dreams. This is all I ask.\"    Julian instantly accepted the sage's terms and promised thathe would carry their precious message to the West. As the two menmoved still higher up the mountain path to the lost village of Sivana,the Indian sun started to set, a fiery red circle slipping into a soft,magical slumber after a long and weary day. Julian told me he hasnever forgotten the majesty of that moment, walking with anageless Indian monk for whom he somehow felt a brotherly love,travelling to a place he had longed to find, with all its wonders andmany mysteries.     \"This was definitely the most memorable moment of my life,\"he confided in me. Julian had always believed that life came downto a few key moments. This was one of them. Deep inside his soul,he somehow sensed that this was the first moment of the rest ofhis life, a life soon to be much more than it had ever been.                          CHAPTER FOUR         A Magical Meeting with           The Sages of SivanaAfter walking for many hours along an intricate series of pathsand grassy trails, the two travellers came upon a lusty greenvalley. On one side of the valley, the snow-capped Himalayasoffered their protection, like weather-beaten soldiers guardingthe place where their generals rested. On the other, a thick forestof pine trees sprouted, a perfectly natural tribute to thisenchanting fantasyland.     The sage looked at Julian and smiled gently, \"Welcome to theNirvana of Sivana.\"     The two then descended along another less-travelled way andinto the thick forest which formed the floor of the valley. The smellof pine and sandalwood wafted through the cool, crisp mountainair. Julian, now barefoot to ease his aching feet, felt the damp mossunder his toes. He was surprised to see richly colored orchids anda host of other lovely flowers dancing among the trees, as ifrejoicing in the beauty and splendor of this tiny slice of Heaven.     In the distance, Julian could hear gentle voices, soft andsoothing to the ear. He continued to follow the sage withoutmaking a sound. After walking for about fifteen more minutes, thetwo men reached a clearing. Before him was a sight that even theworldly wise and rarely surprised Julian Mantle could never haveimagined—a small village made solely out of what appeared to beroses. At the center of the village was a tiny temple, the kindJulian had seen on his trips to Thailand and Nepal, but this templewas made of red, white and pink flowers, held together with longstrands of multi-colored string and twigs. The little huts whichdotted the remaining space appeared to be the austere homes ofthe sages. These were also made of roses. Julian was speechless.    As for the monks who inhabited the village, those he could seelooked like Julian's travelling companion, who now revealed thathis name was Yogi Raman. He explained that he was the eldestsage of Sivana and the leader of this group. The citizens of thisdreamlike colony looked astonishingly youthful and moved withpoise and purpose. None of them spoke, choosing instead torespect the tranquility of this place by performing their tasks insilence.    The men, who appeared to number only about ten, wore thesame red-robed uniform as Yogi Raman and smiled serenely atJulian as he entered their village. Each of them looked calm,healthy and deeply contented. It was as if the tensions whichplague so many of us in our modern world had sensed that theywere not welcome at this summit of serenity and moved on tomore inviting prospects. Though it had been many years sincethere had been a new face amongst them, these men werecontrolled in their reception, offering a simple bow as theirgreeting to this visitor who had travelled so far to find them.    The women were equally impressive. In their flowing pink silksaris and with white lotuses adorning their jet black hair, theymoved busily through the village with exceptional agility.However, this was not the frantic busyness that pervades the livesof people in our society. Instead, theirs was of the easy, gracefulkind. With Zen-like focus, some worked inside the temple,preparing for what appeared to be a festival. Others carriedfirewood and richly embroidered tapestries. All were engaged inproductive activity. All appeared to be happy.    Ultimately, the faces of the Sages of Sivana revealed the powerof their way of life. Even though they were clearly mature adults,each one of them radiated a child-like quality, their eyes twinklingwith the vitality of youth. None of them had wrinkles. None ofthem had gray hair. None of them looked old.    Julian, who could scarcely believe what he was experiencing,was offered a feast of fresh fruits and exotic vegetables, a diet thathe would later learn was one of the keys to the treasure trove ofideal health enjoyed by the sages. After the meal, Yogi Ramanescorted Julian to his living quarters: a flower-filled hut containinga small bed with an empty journal pad on it. This would be hishome for the foreseeable future.    Though Julian had never seen anything like this magical worldof Sivana, he somehow felt that this had been a homecoming ofsorts, a return to a paradise that he had known long ago. Somehowthis village of roses was not so foreign to him. His intuition told himthat he belonged here, if only for a short period. This would be theplace where he would rekindle the fire for living that he had knownbefore the legal profession stole his soul, a sanctuary where hisbroken spirit would slowly start to heal. And so began Julian's lifeamong the Sages of Sivana, a life of simplicity, serenity andharmony. The best was soon to come.                          CHAPTER FIVE             A Spiritual Student                 of the Sages         Great dreamers' dreams are never fulfilled, they     are always transcended.                                      Alfred Lord WhiteheadIt was now 8:00 p.m. and I still had to prepare for my courtappearance the next day. Yet I was fascinated by the experience ofthis former legal warrior who had dramatically transformed his lifeafter meeting and studying under these marvellous sages fromIndia. How amazing, I thought, and what an extraordinarytransformation! I secretly wondered whether the secrets Julianhad learned in that far off mountain hideaway could also elevatethe quality of my life and replenish my own sense of wonder for theworld we live in. The longer I listened to Julian, the more I came torealize that my own spirit had become rusty. What had happenedto the uncommon passion I brought to everything I did when I wasyounger? Back then, even the simplest of things filled me with asense of joy. Maybe it was time for me to reinvent my destiny.     Sensing my fascination with his odyssey and my eagerness tolearn the system of enlightened living that the sages had passed onto him, Julian quickened the pace as he continued with his tale. Hetold me how his desire for knowledge, coupled with his sharpintellect—refined through many years of battles in the courtroomhad made him a well-loved member of the Sivana community. As amark of their affection for Julian, the monks eventually made himan honorary member of their band and treated him like an integralpart of their extended family.     Eager to expand his knowledge of the workings of the mind,body and soul, and to attain self-mastery, Julian spent literallyevery waking moment under the tutelage of Yogi Raman. The sagebecame more like a father to Julian than a teacher, though theywere separated in age by only a few years. It was clear that thisman had the accumulated wisdom of many lifetimes and, mosthappily, he was willing to share it with Julian.     Beginning before dawn, Yogi Raman would sit with hisenthusiastic student and fill his mind with insights on the meaningof life and little-known techniques that he had mastered for livingwith greater vitality, creativity and fulfillment. He taught Julianancient principles which he said anyone could use to live longer,stay younger and grow far happier. Julian also learned how thetwin disciplines of personal mastery and self-responsibility wouldkeep him from returning to the chaos of crisis that hadcharacterized his life in the West. As the weeks slipped intomonths, he came to understand the treasure-trove of potentialsleeping within his own mind, waiting to be awakened and used forhigher purposes. Sometimes the teacher and his student wouldsimply sit and watch the blazing Indian sun rising from the deepgreen meadows far below. Sometimes they would rest in quietmeditation, savoring the gifts that silence brings. Sometimes theywould walk through the pine forest, discussing points ofphilosophy and enjoying the pleasures of each other's company.     Julian said that the first indications of his personal expansioncame after only three weeks in Sivana. He started noticing thebeauty in the most ordinary of things. Whether it was the marvelof a starry night or the enchantment of a spider's web after it hadrained, Julian absorbed it all. He also said that his new lifestyleand the new habits associated with it started to have a profoundeffect on his inner world. Within a month of applying the principlesand techniques of the sages, he told me that he had begun tocultivate the deep sense of peace and inner serenity that hadeluded him in all the years he had lived in the West. He becamemore joyful and spontaneous, growing more energetic andcreative with each passing day.     Physical vitality and spiritual strength followed the changes inJulian's attitude. His once overweight frame grew strong and leanwhile the sickly pallor which had characterized his face wasreplaced by a splendid shimmer of health. He actually felt as if hecould do anything, be anything and unlock the infinite potentialthat he learned was inside every one of us. He started to cherishlife and to see the divinity in every aspect of it. The ancient systemof this mystical band of monks had started to work its miracles.     After pausing as if to express disbelief at his own tale, Juliangrew philosophical. \"I've realized something very important, John.The world, and that includes my inner world, is a very specialplace. I've also come to see that success on the outside meansnothing unless you also have success within. There is a hugedifference between well-being and being well-off When I was ahotshot lawyer, I used to snicker at all those people who worked atimproving their inner and outer lives. 'Get a life!' I thought. But Ihave learned that self-mastery and the consistent care of one'smind, body and soul are essential to finding one's highest self andliving the life of one's dreams. How can you care for others if youcannot even care for yourself? How can you do good if you don'teven feel good? I can't love you if I cannot love myself,\" he offered.     Suddenly Julian grew flustered and slightly uneasy. \"I'venever opened my heart to anyone like this before. I apologize forthis, John. It is just that I experienced such a catharsis up in thosemountains, such a spiritual awakening to the powers of theuniverse, that I feel others need to know what I know.\"     Noticing that it was getting late, Julian quickly told me hewould take his leave and bid me adieu.     \"You can't leave now, Julian. I'm really pumped to hear thewisdom you learned in the Himalayas and the message youpromised your teachers you would bring back to the West. Youcan't leave me in suspense — you know I can't stand it.\"     \"I'll be back, rest assured, my friend. You know me, once Istart telling a good story I just can't stop. But you have your workto do, and I have some private matters that need to be taken careof.\"     \"Just tell me one thing then. Will the methods you learned inSivana work for me?\"     \"When the student is ready, the teacher appears,\" came theswift reply. \"You, along with so many others in our society, areready for the wisdom I now have the privilege of holding. Everyone of us should know the philosophy of the sages. Every one of uscan benefit by it. Every one of us must know of the perfection thatis their natural state. I promise I will share their ancientknowledge with you. Have patience. I will meet you againtomorrow night, this time at your house. Then I'll tell you all thatyou need to know to put far more living into your life. Is that fair?\"    \"Yeah, I guess if I've done without it all these years, waitinganother twenty-four hours won't kill me,\" I responded withdisappointment.    And with that, the master litigator turned enlightened yogi ofthe East was gone, leaving me with a mind full of unansweredquestions and unfinished thoughts.    As I sat in my office quietly, I realized how small our worldreally was. I thought about the vast pool of knowledge that I hadnot even begun to dip my fingers into. I thought about how itmight feel to regain my own zest for living, and about the curiosityI had had when I was younger. I would love to feel more alive andto bring unbridled energy to my days. Maybe I too would leave thelegal profession. Maybe there was a higher calling for me as well?With these weighty considerations on my mind, I turned out thelights, locked the door to my office and walked out into the thickheat of another summer's night.                          CHAPTER SIX                 The Wisdom of                 Personal Change      I am an artist at living — my work of art is my life.                                                     SuzukiTrue to his word, Julian showed up at my home the next evening.At about 7:15 p.m., I heard four quick knocks on the front door ofmy house, a Cape Cod design with awful pink shutters that mywife believed made our house look like something out ofArchitectural Digest. Julian himself looked strikingly differentthan he had the day before. He still embodied radiant health andexuded a wonderful sense of calm. It was what he was wearing thatmade me a little uncomfortable.    Adorning his obviously supple body was a long red robetopped by an ornately embroidered blue hood. And though it wasanother sticky night in July, the hood covered his head.    \"Greetings my friend,\" Julian offered enthusiastically.    \"Greetings.\"    \"Don't look so alarmed, what did you expect me to wear —Armani?\"    We both started to laugh, softly at first. Soon our giggles hadturned to guffaws. Julian certainly had not lost that wicked senseof humor that had kept me entertained so long ago.    As we relaxed in my cluttered but comfortable living room, Icouldn't help but notice the ornate necklace of wooden prayerbeads dangling from his neck.    \"What are those? They're really beautiful.\"    \"More about these later,\" he said, rubbing some of the beadswith his thumb and index finger. \"We have much to talk abouttonight.\"    \"Let's get started. I could hardly get anything done at worktoday I was so excited about our meeting.\"    Hearing his cue, Julian immediately started to reveal moreabout his personal transformation and the ease with which itwas effected. He told me of the ancient techniques he hadlearned for mind control and for erasing the habit of worrythat was consuming so many in our complex society. He spokeof the wisdom that Yogi Raman and the other monks hadshared for living a more purposeful and rewarding life. And hespoke of a series of methods to unleash the wellspring ofyouthfulness and energy he said every one of us hasslumbering deep inside of us.    Though the conviction with which he spoke was clear, I beganto grow skeptical. Was I the victim of some prank? After all, thisHarvard-trained lawyer was once widely known within the firmfor his practical jokes. As well, his story was nothing less thanfantastic. Think about it: one of this country's best known triallawyers throws in the towel, sells all his worldly goods and treksoff to India on a spiritual odyssey, only to return as a wiseprophet from the Himalayas. This could not be real.     \"C'mon Julian. Stop pulling my leg. This whole story isstarting to smack of one of your gags. I'll bet you rented that robefrom the costume shop across the street from my office,\" Isuggested, breaking into my best fear grin.     Julian was quick to respond, as if my disbelief was somethinghe had expected. \"In court, how do you prove your case?\"     \"I offer persuasive evidence.\"     \"Right. Look at the evidence that I have offered you. Look atmy smooth, lineless face. Look at my physique. Can't you sensethe abundance of energy I have? Look at my peacefulness. Surelyyou can see that I have changed?\"     He had a point. This was a man who, only a few years ago, hadlooked decades older.     \"You didn't go to a plastic surgeon did you?\"     \"No,\" he smiled. \"They only focus on the outer person. Ineeded to be healed from within. My unbalanced, chaotic lifestyleleft me in great distress. It was much more than a heart attackthat I suffered. It was a rupture of my inner core.\"     \"But your story, it's so . . . mysterious and unusual.\"     Julian remained calm and patient in the face of my persistence.Spotting the pot of tea I had left on the table next to him, hestarted to pour into my waiting cup. He poured until the cup wasfull—but then he kept on pouring! Tea started to trickle down thesides of the cup and into the saucer, then onto my wife's prizedPersian rug. At first I watched silently. Then I couldn't take it anymore.   \"Julian, what are you doing? My cup is overflowing. No matterhow hard you try, no more will go in!\" I yelled impatiently.   He looked at me for a long moment. \"Please don't take this thewrong way. I really respect you, John. I always have. However,just like this cup, you seem to be full of your own ideas. And howcan any more go in. . . until you first empty your cup?\"     I was struck by the truth of his words. He was right. My manyyears in the conservative legal world, doing the same things everyday with the same people who thought the same thoughts everyday had filled my cup to the brim. My wife Jenny was alwaystelling me that we should be meeting new people and exploringnew things. \"I wish you were just a little more adventurous, John,\"she would say.     I couldn't remember the last time I had read a book that didn'tdeal with law. The profession was my life. I began to realize thatthe sterile world I had grown accustomed to had dulled mycreativity and limited my vision.     \"Okay. I see your point,\" I admitted. \"Perhaps all my years asa trial lawyer have made me a hardened skeptic. From the minuteI saw you in my office yesterday, something deep inside me told methat your transformation was genuine, and that there was somesort of lesson in it for me. Maybe I just didn't want to believe it.\"     \"John, tonight is the first night of your new life. I simply askthat you think deeply about the wisdom and strategies that I willshare with you and apply them with conviction for a period of onemonth. Embrace the methods with a deep trust in theireffectiveness. There is a reason why they have survived forthousands of years — they work.\"     \"One month seems like a long time.\"     \"Six hundred and seventy-two hours of inner work toprofoundly improve every waking moment of the rest of your lifeis quite a bargain, don't you think? Investing in yourself is the bestinvestment you will ever make. It will not only improve your life,it will improve the lives of all those around you.\"     \"How's that?\"     \"It is only when you have mastered the art of loving yourselfthat you can truly love others. It's only when you have opened yourown heart that you can touch the hearts of others. When you feelcentered and alive, you are in a much better position to be a betterperson.\"     \"What can I expect to happen in those six hundred andseventy-two hours that comprise one month?\" I asked earnestly.     \"You will experience changes within the workings of yourmind, body and even your soul that will astonish you. You will havemore energy, enthusiasm and inner harmony than you have had in,perhaps, your entire life. People will actually begin telling you thatyou look younger and happier. A lasting sense of well-being andbalance will swiftly return to your life. These are just some of thebenefits of the Sivanan System.\"     \"Wow.\"     \"All of what you will hear tonight is designed to improve yourlife, not just personally and professionally but spiritually as well.The advice of the sages is just as current today as it was fivethousand years ago. It will not only enrich your inner world, it willenhance your outer world and make you far more effective in allthat you do. This wisdom is truly the most potent force I have everencountered. It is straightforward, practical and has been testedin the laboratory of life for centuries. Most importantly, it will workfor anyone. But before I share this knowledge with you, I must askyou for a promise.\"     I knew there would be strings attached. \"There are no freelunches,\" my loving mother used to say.     \"Once you see the power of the strategies and skills shown tome by the Sages of Sivana and observe the dramatic results theywill bring to your life, you must make it your mission to pass thiswisdom on to others who will benefit from this knowledge. This isall that I ask of you. By agreeing to this, you will help me fulfill myown pact with Yogi Raman.\"     I agreed without reservation, Julian began to teach me thesystem he had come to consider as sacred. While the techniquesthat Julian had mastered during his stay were varied, at the heartof the Sivanan System were seven basic virtues, sevenfundamental principles which embodied the keys to self-leadership, personal responsibility and spiritual enlightenment.     Julian told me that Yogi Raman was the first to share the sevenvirtues with him after a few months in Sivana. On a clear night,when all the others had drifted off into deep slumber, Ramanknocked softly on the door of Julian's hut. In the voice of a gentleguide, he spoke his mind: \"I have observed you closely for manydays now Julian. I believe that you are a decent man who deeplydesires to fill his life with all that is good. Since you have arrivedyou have opened yourself up to our traditions and embraced themas your own. You have learned a number of our daily habits, andhave seen their many salutary effects. You have been respectful ofour ways. Our people have lived this simple, peaceful life throughcountless ages and our methods are known to but a few. Theworld needs to hear our philosophy on enlightened living. Tonight,on the eve of your third month in Sivana, I will begin to share theinner workings of our system with you, not only for your benefitbut for the benefit of all those in your part of the world. I will sitwith you daily as I sat with my son when he was a child. Sadly, hepassed on a few years ago. His time had come and I do not questionhis exit. I enjoyed our time together and cherish the memories. Inow see you as my son and I feel grateful that all I have learnedover many years of silent contemplation will live on within you.\"     I looked at Julian and noticed that his eyes were now shut, asif he were transporting himself back to this fairy-tale land that hadshowered the blessing of knowledge on him.     \"Yogi Raman told me that the seven virtues for a lifeoverflowing with inner peace, joy and a wealth of spiritual giftswere contained within a mystical fable, this fable was the essenceof it all. He asked me to shut my eyes as I have now done, here onthe floor of your living room. He then told me to picture thefollowing scene in my mind's eye:    You are sitting in the middle of a magnificent, lush, green   garden. This garden is filled with the most spectacular   flowers you have ever seen. The environment is supremely    tranquil and silent. Savor the sensual delights of this   garden and feel as if you have all the time in the world to    enjoy this natural oasis. As you look around you see that    in the center of this magical garden stands a towering, red    lighthouse, six stories high. Suddenly, the silence of the   garden is disturbed by a loud creaking as the door at the    base of the lighthouse opens. Out stumbles a nine-foot-tall,    nine-hundred-pound Japanese sumo wrestler who    casually wanders into the center of the garden.    \"It gets better,\" chuckled Julian. \"The Japanese sumowrestler is naked! Well, actually he is not totally naked. He has apink wire cable covering his private parts.\"   As this sumo wrestler starts to move around the garden,   he finds a shiny gold stopwatch which someone had left    behind many years earlier. He slips it on, and falls to the   ground with an enormous thud. The sumo wrestler is   rendered unconscious and lies there, silent and still. Just   when you think he has taken his last breath, the wrestler    awakens, perhaps stirred by the fragrance of some fresh   yellow roses blooming nearby. Energized, the wrestler   jumps swiftly to his feet and intuitively looks to his left.   He is startled at what he sees. Through the bushes at the   very edge of the garden he observes a long winding path   covered by millions of sparkling diamonds. Something   seems to instruct the wrestler to take the path, and to his   credit, he does. This path leads him down the road of   everlasting joy and eternal bliss.     After hearing this strange tale high atop the Himalayas,seated next to a monk who had seen the torchlight ofenlightenment first-hand, Julian told me that he was disappointed.Quite simply, he said that he thought he was going to hearsomething earth-shattering, knowledge that would stir him toaction, perhaps even move him to tears. Instead, all he heard wasa silly story about a sumo wrestler and a lighthouse.     Yogi Raman detected his dismay. \"Never overlook the powerof simplicity,\" Julian was told.     \"This story may not be the sophisticated discourse that youexpected,\" said the sage, \"but there is a universe of sensibility inits message and a purity in its purpose. From the day you arrived,I have thought long and hard as to how I would share ourknowledge with you. At first I considered giving you a series oflectures over a period of months but realized that this traditionalapproach was ill-suited to the magical nature of the wisdom youare about to receive. I then thought of asking all of my brothersand sisters to spend a little time with you every day tutoring youin our philosophy. However, this too was not the most effective wayfor you to learn what it is we have to tell. After great deliberation,I finally arrived at what I thought was a very creative yet highlyeffective way to share the entire system of Sivana with its sevenvirtues. . . and that is this mystical fable.\"     The sage added: \"At first it might seem to be frivolous andperhaps even childish. But I assure you that every element of thefable embodies a timeless principle for radiant living and has greatdepth of meaning. The garden, the lighthouse, the sumo wrestler,the pink wire cable, the stopwatch, the roses and the winding pathof diamonds are symbols of the seven timeless virtues for anenlightened life. I can also assure you that if you remember thislittle story and the fundamental truths that it represents, you willcarry within you all that you need to know to raise your life to itshighest level. You will have all the information and strategies youwill need to profoundly influence the quality of your life and thelives of all those you touch. And when you apply this wisdom on adaily basis, you will change—mentally, emotionally, physically andspiritually. Please write this story deep into your mind and carry itwithin your heart It will only make a dramatic difference if youembrace it without reservation.\"    \"Luckily John,\" said Julian, \"I did embrace it. Carl Jung oncesaid that 'your vision will become clear only when you can look intoyour heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside,awakens.' On that very special night, I looked deep into my heartand awakened to the secrets of the ages for enriching the mind,cultivating the body and nourishing the soul. It is now my turn toshare them with you.\"                          CHAPTER SEVEN  A Most Extraordinary Garden         Most people live—whether physically, intellectually     or morally—in a very restricted circle of their potential     being. We all have reservoirs of life to draw upon of     which we do not dream.                                                William James\"In the fable, the garden is a symbol for the mind,\" said Julian. \"Ifyou care for your mind, if you nurture it and if you cultivate it justlike a fertile, rich garden, it will blossom far beyond yourexpectations. But if you let the weeds take root, lasting peace ofmind and deep inner harmony will always elude you.    \"John, let me ask you a simple question. If I went into yourbackyard where you have that garden you used to tell me somuch about and threw toxic waste over all your prized petunias,you wouldn't be thrilled, would you?\"    \"Agreed.\"    \"As a matter of fact, most good gardeners guard their gardenslike proud soldiers and make certain that no contamination everenters. Yet look at the toxic waste that most people put into thefertile garden of their minds every single day: the worries andanxieties, the fretting about the past, the brooding over the futureand those self-created fears that wreak havoc within your innerworld. In the native language of the Sages of Sivana, which hasexisted for thousands of years, the written character for worry isstrikingly similar to the character symbolizing a funeral pyre. YogiRaman told me that this was no mere coincidence. Worry drainsthe mind of much of its power and, sooner or later, it injures thesoul.\"     \"To live life to the fullest, you must stand guard at the gate ofyour garden and let only the very best information enter. You trulycannot afford the luxury of a negative thought—not even one. Themost joyful, dynamic and contented people of this world are nodifferent from you or me in terms of their makeup. We are all fleshand bones. We all come from the same universal source. However,the ones who do more than just exist, the ones who fan the flamesof their human potential and truly savor the magical dance of lifedo different things than those whose lives are ordinary. Foremostamongst the things that they do is adopt a positive paradigm abouttheir world and all that is in it.\"    Julian added: \"The sages taught me that on an average daythe average person runs about sixty thousand thoughts throughhis mind. What really amazed me though, was that ninety-fivepercent of those thoughts were the same as the ones you thoughtthe day before!\"    \"Are you serious?\" I asked.     \"Very. This is the tyranny of impoverished thinking. Thosepeople who think the same thoughts every day, most of themnegative, have fallen into bad mental habits. Rather than focusingon all the good in their lives and thinking of ways to make thingseven better, they are captives of their pasts. Some of them worryabout failed relationships or financial problems. Others fret overtheir less-than-perfect childhoods. Still others brood over moretrifling matters: the way a store clerk might have treated them orthe comment of a co-worker that smacked of ill-will. Those whorun their minds in this fashion are allowing worry to rob them oftheir life force. They are blocking the enormous potential of theirminds to work magic and deliver into their lives all that they want,emotionally, physically and, yes, even spiritually. These peoplenever realize that mind management is the essence of lifemanagement.      \"The way you think stems from habit, pure and simple,\"Julian continued with conviction. \"Most people just don't realizethe enormous power of their minds. I have learned that even thebest-conditioned thinkers are using only 1/100th of a percent oftheir mental reserves. In Sivana, the sages dared to explore theuntapped potential of their mental capacity on a regular basis.And the results were astounding. Yogi Raman, through regularand disciplined practice, had conditioned his mind so that he wasable to slow down his heartbeat at will. He had even trainedhimself to go for weeks without sleep. While I would neversuggest that these should be goals for you to aspire to, I dosuggest that you start to see your mind for what it is — nature'sgreatest gift.\"      \"Are there some exercises I can do to unlock this mind power?Being able to slow down my heartbeat would definitely make mea hit on the cocktail-party circuit,\" I suggested cheekily.      \"Don't worry about that now, John. I'll give you some practicaltechniques that you can try later that will show you the power ofthis ancient technology. For now, what is important is that youunderstand that mental mastery comes through conditioning,nothing more and nothing less. Most of us have the same rawmaterials from the moment we take our first breath of air; whatseparates those people who achieve more than others or those thatare happier than others is the way that they use and refine theseraw materials. When you dedicate yourself to transforming yourinner world your life quickly shifts from the ordinary into therealm of the extraordinary.\"    My teacher was growing more excited by the moment. Hiseyes seemed to twinkle as he spoke of the magic of the mind andthe wealth of goodness it would surely bring.    \"You know John, when all is said and done, there is only onething that we have absolute dominion over.\"    \"Our kids?\" I said, smiling good-naturedly.    \"No, my friend — our minds. We might not be able to controlthe weather or the traffic or the moods of all those around us. But,we most certainly can control our attitude towards these events.We all have the power to determine what we will think about in anygiven moment. This ability is part of what makes us human. Yousee, one of the fundamental gems of worldly wisdom I havelearned in my travels to the East is also one of the most simple.\"    Julian then paused as if to summon up a priceless gift.    \"And what might that be?\"    \"There is no such thing as objective reality or 'the real world.'There are no absolutes. The face of your greatest enemy mightbe the face of my finest friend. An event that appears to be atragedy to one might reveal the seeds of unlimited opportunity toanother. What really separates people who are habitually upbeatand optimistic from those who are consistently miserable is howthe circumstances of life are interpreted and processed.\"     \"Julian, how could a tragedy be anything but a tragedy?\"     \"Here's a quick example. When I was travelling throughCalcutta, I met a schoolteacher named Malika Chand. She lovedteaching and treated her students as she would her own children,nurturing their potential with great kindness. Her perennialmotto was 'Your I can is more important than your I.Q.' She wasknown throughout her community as a person who lived to give,who selflessly served anyone in need. Sadly, her beloved school,which had stood as a silent witness to the delightful progress ofgenerations of children, succumbed to the flames of a fire set by anarsonist one night. All those in the community felt this great loss.But as time passed, their anger gave way to apathy and theyresigned themselves to the fact that their children would bewithout a school.\"     \"What about Malika?\"     \"She was different, an eternal optimist if there ever was one.Unlike everyone around her, she perceived opportunity in whathad happened. She told all the parents that every setback offersan equivalent benefit if they took the time to search for it. Thisevent was a gift in disguise. The school that burned to the groundwas old and decrepit. The roof leaked and the floor had finallybuckled under the strain of a thousand little feet scamperingacross its surface. This was the chance that they had been waitingfor to join hands as a community and build a much better school,one that would serve many more children in the years to come.And so, with this sixty-four-year-old dynamo behind them, theymarshalled their collective resources and raised enough funds tobuild a sparkling new school, one that stood as a shining exampleof the power of vision in the face of adversity.\"     \"So it's like that old adage about seeing the cup as half fullrather than half empty?\"     \"That's a fair way to look at it. No matter what happens to youin your life, you alone have the capacity to choose your response toit. When you form the habit of searching for the positive in everycircumstance, your life will move into its highest dimensions. Thisis one of the greatest of all the natural laws.\"     \"And it all starts with using your mind more effectively?\"     \"Exactly, John. All success in life, whether material orspiritual, starts with that twelve-pound mass sitting between yourshoulders. Or more specifically, with the thoughts that you put intoyour mind every second of every minute of every day. Your outerworld reflects the state of your inner world. By controlling thethoughts that you think and the way you respond to the events ofyour life, you begin to control your destiny.\"     \"This makes so much sense, Julian. I guess my life has becomeso busy that I have never taken the time to think about thesethings. When I was in law school, my best friend Alex used to lovereading inspirational books. He said that they kept him motivatedand energized in the face of our crushing workload. I rememberhim telling me that one of them said that the Chinese character for'crisis' is comprised of two sub-characters: one that spells 'danger'and another that spells 'opportunity.' I guess that even the ancientChinese knew that there is a bright side to the darkestcircumstance — if you have the courage to look for it.\"     \"Yogi Raman put it this way: 'There are no mistakes in life,only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, onlyopportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be awonderful teacher.' \"     \"Pain?\" I protested.     \"Absolutely. To transcend pain, you must first experience it. Orto put it another way, how can you really know the joy of being onthe summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowestvalley. Get my point?\"     \"To savor the good one must know the bad?\"     \"Yes. But I suggest that you stop judging events as eitherpositive or negative. Rather, simply experience them, celebratethem and learn from them. Every event offers you lessons. Theselittle lessons fuel your inner and outer growth. Without them, youwould be stuck on a plateau. Just think about it in your own life.Most people have grown the most from their most challengingexperiences. And if you meet with an outcome you did not expectand feel a little disappointed, remember that the laws of naturealways ensure that when one door closes another opens.\"    Julian started to raise his arms in excitement, much as aSouthern minister might while preaching to his congregation.\"Once you consistently apply this principle to your daily life andstart to condition your mind to translate every event into apositive, empowering one, you will banish worry forever. You willstop being a prisoner of your past. Instead, you will become thearchitect of your future.\"    \"Okay, I understand the concept. Every experience, even theworst, offers me a lesson. Therefore, I should open my mind to thelearning in every event. In this way, I will grow stronger andhappier. What else might a humble, middle-class lawyer do toimprove things?\"    \"First of all, begin to live out of the glory of your imagination,not your memory.\"    \"Run that one by me again.\"     'All I'm saying is that to liberate the potential of your mind,body and soul, you must first expand your imagination. You see,things are always created twice: first in the workshop of the mindand then, and only then, in reality. I call the process 'blueprinting'because anything that you create in your outer world began as asimple blueprint in your inner world, on the lush picture screen ofyour mind. When you learn to take control of your thoughts andvividly imagine all that you desire from this worldly existence in astate of total expectancy, dormant forces will awaken inside you.You will begin to unlock the true potential of your mind to createthe kind of magical life that I believe you deserve. From tonightonwards, forget about the past. Dare to dream that you are morethan the sum of your current circumstances. Expect the best. Youwill be astonished at the results.     \"You know, John, all those years in the legal profession Ithought I knew so much. I spent years studying at the finestschools, reading all the law books I could get my hands on andworking with the best role models. Sure, I was a winner at thegame of law. Yet I how realize I was losing in the game of life. I wasso busy chasing the big pleasures of life that I missed out on all thelittle ones. I never read those great books my father used to tell meto read. I haven't built any great friendships. I've never learned toappreciate great music. Having said this, I really think I am one ofthe lucky ones. My heart attack was my defining moment, mypersonal wake-up call, if you will. Believe it or not, it gave me asecond chance to live a richer, more inspired life. Like MalikaChand, I saw the seeds of opportunity in my painful experience.More importantly, I had the courage to nourish them.\"    I could see that while Julian had grown younger on the outsidehe had grown far wiser within. I realized that this evening wasmore than just a fascinating conversation with an old friend. Irealized that tonight could be ray own defining moment and a clearchance for a new beginning. My mind started to consider all thatwas wrong in my own life. Sure I had a great family and a stablejob as a well-regarded lawyer. Yet in my quiet moments I knewthere had to be more. I had to fill that emptiness that was startingto envelope my life.    When I was a kid, I dreamed such great dreams. Often, Ivisualized myself as a sports hero or as a business tycoon. I reallybelieved that I could do, have and be whatever I wanted to be. Ialso remembered the way I used to feel as a young boy growing upon the sun-splashed west coast. Fun came in the form of simplepleasures. Fun was spending a glorious afternoon skinny-dippingor riding through the woods on my bicycle. I had such a curiosityfor life. I was an adventurer. There were no limits on what myfuture could bring. I honestly don't think I have felt that kind offreedom and joy for fifteen years. What happened?     Perhaps I lost sight of my dreams when I became an adult andresigned myself to acting the way adults were supposed to act.Maybe I lost sight of them when I went to law school and startedtalking like lawyers were supposed to talk. In any event, thatevening with Julian at my side, pouring his heart out over a cup ofcold tea, made me resolve to stop spending so much time makinga living and to spend far more time creating a life.    \"Looks like I have you thinking about your life also,\" Julianobserved. \"Start thinking about your dreams for a change, justlike when you were a little child. Jonas Salk said it best when hewrote: 'I have had dreams and I have had nightmares. I overcamethe nightmares because of my dreams.' Dare to dust off yourdreams John. Start to revere life again and celebrate all of itswonders. Awaken yourself to the power of your own mind to makethings happen. Once you do, the universe will conspire with you towork magic in your life.\"     Julian then reached into the depths of his robe and pulled out alittle card, about the size of a business card, which had tears alongits sides, apparently the result of many months of constant use.     \"One day, while Yogi Raman and I were walking along a quietmountain path, I asked him who his favorite philosopher was. Hetold me that he had many influences in his life, and it was difficultfor him to single out any one source for his inspiration. There wasone quotation, however, that he carried deep within his heart; onethat encapsulated all the values he had come to cherish over a lifespent in quiet contemplation. At that glorious place, deep withinthe middle of nowhere, this learned sage of the East shared it withme. I too etched its words into my heart. They serve as a dailyreminder of all that we are—and all that we can be. The wordscame from the great Indian philosopher Patanjali. Repeating themaloud every morning before I sit down to meditate has had a veryprofound influence on the course of my day. Remember, John,words are the verbal embodiment of power.\"    Julian then showed me the card. The quotation read:    When you are inspired by some great purpose, some    extraordinary project, all of your thoughts break their    bonds: your mind transcends limitations, your    consciousness expands in every direction and you find    yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant   forces, faculties and talents become alive and you discover    yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed    yourself to be.     In that instant, I saw the connection between physical vitalityand mental agility. Julian was in picture-perfect health and lookedmany years younger than he had when we had first met. Hebrimmed with vibrancy and it appeared that his energy, enthusiasmand optimism knew no bounds. I could see that he had made manychanges to his former lifestyle, but it was obvious that the startingpoint of his magnificent transformation was mental fitness. Successon the outside indeed begins with success on the inside, and bychanging his thoughts, Julian Mantle had changed his life.     \"Exactly how can I develop this positive, serene and inspiredattitude, Julian? After all these years in my routine, I think mymental muscles have grown a little flabby. Come to think of it, Ihave very little control over the thoughts that are floating aroundthe garden of my mind,\" I said with sincerity.     \"The mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master. If youhave become a negative thinker, this is because you have not caredfor your mind and taken the time to train it to focus on the good.Winston Churchill said that 'the price of greatness is,responsibility over each of your thoughts.' Then you will install thevibrant mindset you are looking for. Remember, the mind truly islike any other muscle in your body. Use it or lose it.\"     \"Are you saying that if I don't exercise my mind it will growweak?\"     \"Yes. Look at it this way. If you want to strengthen themuscles of your arm to achieve more, you must train them. If youwant to toughen up your leg muscles, you must first exert them.Similarly, your mind will do wonderful things for you if only youwill let it. It will attract all that you desire into your life, once youlearn how to operate it effectively. It will create ideal health if youcare for it properly. And it will return to its natural state ofpeacefulness and tranquility — if you have the vision to ask for it.The Sages of Sivana have a very special saying: 'The boundaries ofyour life are merely creations of the self.'\"     \"I don't think I understand that one, Julian.\"     \"Enlightened thinkers know that their thoughts form theirworld and the quality of one's life comes down to the richness ofone's thoughts. If you want to live a more peaceful, meaningful life,you must think more peaceful, meaningful thoughts.\"     \"Hit me with the quick-fix, Julian.\"     \"What do you mean?\" Julian asked gently, running his bronzedfingers along the front of his brilliantly textured robe.     \"I'm excited about what you are telling me. But I'm animpatient guy. Don't you have any exercises or techniques that Ican use right now, here in my own living room, to change the wayI run my mind?\"     \"Quick-fixes do not work. All lasting inner change requirestime and effort. Persistence is the mother of personal change. I'mnot saying that it will take years to make profound changes in yourlife. If you diligently apply the strategies I am sharing with youevery day for only one month, you will be astonished at the results.You will begin to tap into the highest levels of your own capacityand enter the realm of the miraculous. But to reach thisdestination, you must not get hung up on the outcome. Instead,enjoy the process of personal expansion and growth. Ironically, theless you focus on the end result, the quicker it will come.\"     \"How so?\"     \"It's like that classic story of the young boy who travelled farfrom his home to study under a great teacher. When he met thewise old man, his first question was, 'How long will it take mebefore I am as wise as you?'    \"The response came swiftly, 'Five years.'    \"'This is a very long time,' the boy replied. 'How about if Iwork twice as hard?'    '\"Then it will take ten,' said the master.    '\"Ten! That's far too long. How about if I studied all day andwell into the night, every night?'    '\"Fifteen years,' said the sage.    \"'I don't understand,' replied the boy. 'Every time I promise todevote more energy to my goal, you tell me that it will take longer.Why?'    '\"The answer is simple. With one eye fixed on the destination,there is only one left to guide you along the journey'\"    \"Point well taken, counselor,\" I conceded graciously. \"Soundslike the story of my life.\"     \"Be patient and live with the knowledge that all you aresearching for is certain to come if you prepare for it and expect it.\"    \"But I've never been the lucky sort, Julian. All that I have everreceived has come through sheer persistence.\"     \"What is luck, my friend?\" Julian replied kindly. \"It is nothingmore than the marriage of preparation with opportunity.\"    Julian added softly: \"Before I give you the precise methodspassed on to me by the Sages of Sivana, I must first share a coupleof key principles. First, always remember that concentration is atthe root of mental mastery.\"    \"Seriously?\"    \"I know. It surprised me too. But it is true. The mind canaccomplish extraordinary things, you have learned this. The veryfact that you have a desire or a dream means that you have thecorresponding capacity to realize it. This is one of the greatuniversal truths known to the Sages of Sivana. However, toliberate the power of the mind, you must first be able to harness itand direct its focus only to the task at hand. The moment youconcentrate the focus of your mind on a singular purpose,extraordinary gifts will appear within your life.\"    \"Why is it so important to have a concentrated mind?\"    \"Let me offer you a riddle that will answer your questionnicely. Say you were lost in the woods in the middle of the winter.You desperately needed to stay warm. All you have in yourknapsack is a letter your best friend had sent to you, a tin of tunaand a small magnifying glass that you carry to compensate foryour fading eyesight. Luckily, you managed to find some drykindling wood, but unfortunately you have no matches. How wouldyou light the fire?\"    Good grief. Julian had stumped me. I had no idea what theanswer was.    \"I give up.\"    \"It's very simple. Place the letter amongst the dry wood andhold the magnifying glass over it. The rays of the sun will befocused so as to ignite the fire within a matter of seconds.\"    \"And what about the can of tuna?\"    \"Oh, I just threw that in to distract you from the obvioussolution,\" Julian replied with a smile. \"But the essence of theexample is this: putting the letter over the dry wood wouldproduce no result. Yet, the second you use the magnifying glass toconcentrate the scattered rays of the sun onto the letter, it willignite. This analogy holds true for the mind. When youconcentrate its tremendous power on definite, meaningfulobjectives, you will quickly ignite the flames of your personalpotential and produce startling results.\"     \"Like what?\" I asked.     \"Only you can answer this question. What is it that you aresearching for? Do you want to be a better father and live a morebalanced, rewarding life? Do you desire more spiritual fulfillment?Is it adventure and fun that you feel you are lacking? Give it somethought.\"     \"How about eternal happiness?\"     \"Go big or stay home,\" he chuckled, \"Nothing like starting offsmall. Well, you can have that too.\"     \"How?\"     \"The Sages of Sivana have known the secret of happiness forover five thousand years. Fortunately, they were willing to sharethis gift with me. Do you want to hear it?\"     \"No, I thought I'd take a break and go wallpaper the garagefirst.\"     \"Huh?\"     \"Of course I want to hear the secret of eternal happiness,Julian. Isn't that what everyone is searching for, ultimately?\"     \"True. Well here it is . . . could I trouble you for another cupof tea?\"     \"C'mon, quit stalling.\"     \"Alright, the secret of happiness is simple: find out what youtruly love to do and then direct all of your energy towards doingit. If you study the happiest, healthiest, most satisfied people ofour world, you will see that each and every one of them has foundtheir passion in life, and then spent their days pursuing it. Thiscalling is almost always one that, in some way, serves others. Onceyou are concentrating your mind power and energy on a pursuitthat you love, abundance flows into your life, and all your desiresare fulfilled with ease and grace.\"    \"So simply figure out what turns you on and then do it?\"    \"If it is a worthy pursuit,\" Julian replied.    \"How do you define 'worthy'?\"    \"As I said, John, your passion must, in some way, improve orserve the lives of others. \"Victor Frankl said it more elegantly thanI ever could when he wrote: 'Success, like happiness, cannot bepursued. It must ensue. And it only does so as the unintended sideeffect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself.'Once you find out what your life's work is, your world will comealive. You will wake up every morning with a limitless reservoir ofenergy and enthusiasm. All your thoughts will be focused on yourdefinite objective. You won't have time to waste time. Valuablemental power will, therefore, not be wasted on trifling thoughts.You will automatically erase the worry habit and become far moreeffective and productive. Interestingly, you will also have a deepsense of inner harmony, as if you are somehow being guided torealize your mission. It is a wonderful feeling. I love it,\" Julianoffered gleefully.     \"Fascinating. And I like the part about getting up feeling good.To be really honest with you, Julian, most days I wish I could juststay under the covers. It would be so much better than facing thetraffic, the angry clients, the aggressive opponents and theceaseless flow of negative influences. It all makes me feel so tired.\"     \"Do you know why most people sleep so much?\"     \"Why?\"     \"Because they really don't have anything else to do. Those whorise with the sun all have one thing in common.\"     \"Insanity?\"     \"Very funny. No, they all have a purpose that fans the flamesof their inner potential. They are driven by their priorities, but notin an unhealthy, obsessive way. It is more effortless and gentlethan that. And given their enthusiasm and love for what they aredoing in their lives, such people live in the moment. Their attentionis fully and completely on the task at hand. Therefore, there are noenergy leaks. These people are the most vibrant and vitalindividuals you will ever have the good fortune to meet.\"     \"Energy leaks? Sounds a little New Agey, Julian. I'll bet youdidn't learn that one at Harvard Law School.\"     \"True. The Sages of Sivana pioneered that concept. Though ithas been around for centuries, its application is just as relevanttoday as it was when it was first developed. Too many of us areconsumed by needless and endless worry. This drains us of ournatural vitality and energy. Have you ever seen the inner tube of abicycle tire?\"     \"Of course.\"     \"When it is fully inflated, it can easily take you to yourdestination. But if there are leaks in it, the tube eventuallydeflates, and your journey comes to an abrupt end. This is alsohow the mind works. Worry causes your precious mental energyand potential to leak, just like air leaking out of an inner tube.Soon, you have no energy left. All of your creativity, optimism andmotivation has been drained, leaving you exhausted.\"     \"I know the feeling. I often spend my days in the chaos ofcrisis. I have to be everywhere at once and I can't seem to pleaseanyone. On those days, I notice that even though I have done verylittle physical labor, all my worrying leaves me totally deflated bythe end of the day. About the only thing I can do when I get homeis pour myself a scotch and cuddle up with the remote control.\"   \"Exactly. Too much stress does this to you. Once you find yourpurpose, however, life becomes much easier and far morerewarding. When you figure out what your main aim or destinyreally is, you will never have to work another day in your life.\"    \"Early retirement?\"    \"No,\" said Julian in the no-nonsense tone he had masteredduring his days as an eminent lawyer. \"Your work will be play.\"    \"Wouldn't it be a little risky for me to give up my job to startsearching for my overriding passion and purpose? I mean, I havea family and real obligations. I have four people who depend onme.\"    \"I'm not saying you that have to leave the legal professiontomorrow. You will, however, have to start taking risks. Shake upyour life a bit. (Jet rid of the cobwebs. Take the road less travelled.Most people live within the confines of their comfort zone. YogiRaman was the first person to explain to me that the best thingyou can do for yourself is regularly move beyond it. This is the wayto lasting personal mastery and to realize the true potential ofyour human endowments.\"    \"And what might those be?\"    \"Your mind, your body and your soul.\"    \"So what risks should I take?\"    \"Stop being so practical. Start doing the things you havealways wanted to do. I have known lawyers who have quit theirjobs to become stage actors and accountants who have become jazzmusicians. In the process, they have found the deep happiness thathad eluded them for so long. So what if they could no longer affordtwo vacations a year and a posh summer home in the Caymans?Calculated risk taking will pay huge dividends. How will you everget to third base with one foot on second?\"    \"I see your point.\"    \"So take the time to think. Discover your real reason for beinghere and then have the courage to act on it.\"     \"With due respect, Julian, all I do is think. As a matter of fact,part of my problem is that I think too much. My mind never stops.It is filled with mental chatter — it drives me crazy sometimes.\"     \"What I'm suggesting is different. The Sages of Sivana alltook time daily to silently contemplate not only where they were,but where they were going. They took the time to reflect on theirpurpose and how they were living their lives, every day. Mostimportantly, they thought deeply and genuinely about how theywould improve the next day. Daily incremental improvementsproduce lasting results which, in turn, lead to positive change.\"     \"So I should take the time to reflect on my life regularly?\"     \"Yes. Even ten minutes of focused reflection a day will have aprofound impact on the quality of your life.\"     \"I understand where you are coming from, Julian. Theproblem is, once my day gets cranking, I can't even find tenminutes to eat lunch.\"     \"My friend, saying that you don't have time to improve yourthoughts and your life is like saying you don't have time to stop forgas because you are too busy driving. Eventually it will catch upwith you.\"     \"Yeah, I know. Hey, you were going to share some techniqueswith me, Julian,\" I said, hoping to learn some practical ways toapply the wisdom I was hearing.     \"There is one technique for mastering the mind which towersabove all the rest. It is a favorite of the Sages of Sivana who taughtit to me with great faith and trust. After practicing it for onlytwenty-one days I felt more energetic, enthusiastic and vibrantthan I had felt in years. The practice is over four thousand yearsold. It is called The Heart of the Rose.\"     \"Tell me more.\"     \"All that you need to perform this exercise is a fresh rose anda silent place. Natural surroundings are best but a quiet room willalso do nicely. Start to stare at the center of the rose, its heart.Yogi Raman told me that a rose is very much like life: you willmeet thorns along the way but if you have faith and believe inyour dreams you will eventually move beyond the thorns into theglory of the flower. Keep staring at the rose. Notice its color,texture and design. Savor its fragrance and think only about thiswonderful object in front of you. At first, other thoughts will startentering your mind, distracting you from the heart of the rose.This is the mark of an untrained mind. But you need not worry,improvement will come quickly. Simply return your attention tothe object of your focus. Soon your mind will grow strong anddisciplined.\"     \"That's all there is to it? It sounds pretty easy.\"     \"That is the beauty of it, John,\" Julian replied. \"However, thisritual must be performed daily for it to be effective. For the firstfew days, you will find it difficult to spend even five minutes in thisexercise. Most of us live at such a frenetic pace that true stillnessand silence is something foreign and uncomfortable. Most peoplehearing my words will say that they have no time to sit and stareat a flower. These are the same people that will tell you that theyhave no time to enjoy the laughter of children or to walk barefootin the rain. These people say they are too busy to do such things.They don't even have time to build friendships, for friendships alsotake time.\"     \"You know a lot about such people.\"     \"I was one of them,\" said Julian. He then paused and sat still,his intense gaze riveted on the grandfather clock my grandmotherhad given Jenny and I as a housewarming present. \"When I thinkof those who live their lives this way, I remember the words of anold British novelist whose work my father loved to read: 'One mustnot allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the fact thateach moment of life is a miracle — and a mystery.'     \"Persist and spend longer and longer periods savoring theheart of the rose,\" Julian continued in his throaty tone. \"After aweek or two you should be able to perform the technique fortwenty minutes without your mind wandering onto other subjects.This will be your first indication that you are taking back controlof the fortress of your mind. It will then focus only on what youcommand it to focus on. It will then be a wonderful servant, ableto do extraordinary things for you. Remember, either you controlyour mind or it controls you.\"     \"Practically speaking, you will notice that you will feel farcalmer. You will have taken a significant step towards erasing theworry habit that plagues most of the population and you will enjoymore energy and optimism. Most importantly, you will alsoobserve a sense of joyfulness entering your life along with anability to appreciate the many gifts that surround you. Each day,no matter how busy you get and how many challenges you mightface, return to the Heart of the Rose. It is your oasis. It is yoursilent retreat. It is your island of peace. Never forget that there ispower in silence and stillness. Stillness is the stepping stone toconnecting with the universal source of intelligence that throbsthrough every living thing.\"     I was fascinated by what I had heard. Could it really bepossible to profoundly improve the quality of my life with such asimple strategy?    \"There must be more to the dramatic changes I see in youthan the Heart of the Rose.\" I wondered aloud.     \"Yes. This is true. In fact, my transformation came about as aresult of using a number of highly effective strategies in concert.Don't worry, they are all just as simple as the exercise I have justshared with you — and equally as powerful. The key for you, John,is to open your mind to your potential for living a life rich withpossibilities.\"     Julian, ever the fountain of knowledge, continued to revealwhat he had learned in Sivana. \"Another particularly goodtechnique for ridding the mind of worry and other negative, life-draining influences is based on what Yogi Raman called OppositionThinking. I learned that under the grand laws of Nature, the mindcan only hold one thought at any one time. Try it yourself John,you will see that it is true.\"     I did try it and it is true.     \"Using this little-known information, anyone can easilycreate a positive, creative mindset within a short period. Theprocess is straightforward: when an undesirable thoughtoccupies the focal point of your mind, immediately replace it witha uplifting one. It's as if your mind is a giant slide projector, withevery thought in your mind being a slide. Whenever a negativeslide comes up on the screen, take swift action to replace it witha positive one.     \"This is where the prayer beads around my neck come in,\"Julian added with rising enthusiasm. \"Every time I catch myselfthinking a negative thought, I take this necklace off and removeanother bead. These beads of worry go into a cup I keep in myknapsack. Together they serve as gentle reminders that I stillhave a distance to travel on the road to mental mastery andresponsibility over the thoughts that fill my mind.\"     \"Hey, that's a great one! This is really practical stuff I havenever heard anything quite like it. Tell me more about thisphilosophy of Opposition Thinking.\"     \"Here's a real-life example. Let's say you have had a toughday in court. The judge disagreed with your interpretation of thelaw, the litigator on the other side belonged in a cage, and yourclient was more than a little annoyed with your performance. Youcome home and fall into your favorite chair, full of gloom. Step oneis to become aware that you are thinking these uninspiringthoughts. Self-knowledge is the stepping stone to self-mastery.Step two is to appreciate once and for all that just as easily as youallowed those gloomy thoughts to enter, you can replace them withcheerful ones. So think of the opposite of gloom. Concentrate onbeing cheerful and energetic. Feel that you are happy. Perhaps youmight even start to smile. Move your body as you do when you arejoyful and full of enthusiasm. Sit up straight, breathe deeply andtrain the power of your mind on positive thoughts. You will noticea remarkable difference in the way you feel within minutes. Evenmore importantly, if you keep up your practice of OppositionThinking, applying it to every negative thought that habituallyvisits your mind, within weeks you will see that they no longer holdany power. Do you see what I'm getting at?\"    Julian continued his explanation: \"Thoughts are vital, livingthings, little bundles of energy, if you will. Most people don't giveany thought to the nature of their thoughts and yet, the quality ofyour thinking determines the quality of your life. Thoughts arejust as much a part of the material world as the lake you swim inor the street you walk on. Weak minds lead to weak actions. Astrong, disciplined mind, which anyone can cultivate through dailypractice, can achieve miracles. If you want to live life to the fullest,care for your thoughts as you would your most prized possessions.Work hard to remove all inner turbulence. The rewards will beabundant.\"     \"I never saw thoughts as living, things Julian,\" I replied,amazed at this discovery. \"But I can see how they influence everyelement of my world.\"     \"The Sages of Sivana firmly believed that one should onlythink \"Sattvic\" or pure thoughts. They arrived at such a statethrough the techniques I have just shared with you along withother practices such as a natural diet, the repetition of positiveaffirmations or 'mantras' as they called them, reading books richwith wisdom and by constantly ensuring that their company wasenlightened. If even one impure thought entered the temple oftheir minds they would punish themselves by travelling manymiles to an imposing waterfall and standing under the ice-coldwater until they could no longer bear the frigid temperature.\"     \"I thought you told me these sages were wise. Standing underan ice-cold waterfall deep in the Himalayan mountains for thinkingone little negative thought strikes me as extreme behavior.\"     Julian was lightning fast in his response, the result of his manyyears as a world-class legal warrior: \"John, I'll be blunt. You trulycannot afford the luxury of even one negative thought.\"     \"Really?\"     \"Really. A worrisome thought is like an embryo: it starts offsmall but grows and grows. Soon it takes on a life of its own.\"     Julian stopped for a moment and then smiled. \"Sorry if I seema little evangelistic when I speak on this subject, on the philosophyI learned on my journey. It's just that I have discovered tools thatcan improve the lives of many people, people who feel unfulfilled,uninspired and unhappy. A few adjustments in their daily routinesto include the Heart of the Rose technique and a constantapplication of Opposition Thinking will give them the lives theywant. I think they deserve to know this.     \"Before I move from the garden to the next element of YogiRaman's mystical fable, I must let you know of one more secretwhich will offer you great aid in your personal growth. This secretis based on the ancient principle that everything is always createdtwice, first in the mind and then in reality. I have shared alreadythat thoughts are things, material messengers that we send out toinfluence our physical world. I have also informed you that if youhope to make remarkable improvements in your outer world youmust first start within and change the caliber of your thoughts.    \"The Sages of Sivana had a wonderful way to ensure that theirthoughts were pure and wholesome. This technique was alsohighly effective in manifesting their desires, however simple, intoreality. The method will work for anyone. It will work for a younglawyer who seeks financial abundance just as it will work for amother seeking a richer family life or a salesperson seeking toclose more sales. The technique was known to the sages as theSecret of the Lake. To apply it, these teachers would rise at 4:00a.m., as they felt that the early morning possessed magicalqualities from which they could benefit. The sages would thentravel along a series of steep and narrow mountain paths whicheventually led them to the lower reaches of the region theyinhabited. Once there, they would walk along a barely visible traillined with magnificent pine trees and exotic flowers until theyarrived at a clearing. At the edge of the clearing was an aqua bluelake covered by thousands of tiny white lotuses. The water of thelake was strikingly still and calm. It was truly a miraculous sight.The sages told me that this lake had been a friend to theirancestors over the ages.\"    \"What was the Secret of the Lake?\" I asked impatiently.    Julian explained that the sages would look into the waters ofthe still lake and envision their dreams becoming reality. If it wasthe virtue of discipline they wished to cultivate within their livesthey would picture themselves getting up at dawn, performingtheir rigorous physical regimen without fail and spending days insilence to enhance their willpower. If it was more joy they wereseeking, they would look into the lake and envision themselveslaughing uncontrollably or smiling each time they met one of theirbrothers or sisters. If it was courage they desired, they wouldpicture themselves acting with strength in the moment of crisisand challenge.    \"Yogi Raman once told me that as a boy, he lacked confidenceas he was smaller than the other boys his age. While they werekind and gentle to him given their environmental influences, hegrew insecure and shy. To cure this weakness, Yogi Raman wouldtravel to this heavenly spot and use the lake as a picture screen forimages of the person he hoped to be. Some days he would visualizehimself as a strong leader, standing tall and speaking with apowerful, commanding voice. Other days he would see himself ashe wished to be when he grew older: a wise sage filled withtremendous inner strength and character. All the virtues hewished to have in his life, he saw first on the surface of the lake.     \"Within a matter of months, Yogi Raman became the personwhom he mentally saw himself becoming. You see, John, the mindworks through pictures. Pictures affect your self-image and yourself-image affects the way you feel, act and achieve. If your self-image tells you that you are too young to be a successful lawyer ortoo old to change your habits for the better, you never will achievethese goals. If your self-image tells you that lives rich withpurpose, excellent health and happiness are only for people frombackgrounds other than your own, this prophecy will ultimatelybecome your reality.    \"But when you run inspiring, imaginative pictures through themovie screen of your mind, wonderful things start to happen inyour life. Einstein said that 'imagination is more important thanknowledge.' You must spend some time every day, even if it is justa few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. See yourselfas you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, agreat father or a great citizen of your community.\"    \"Do I have to find a special lake to apply the Secret of theLake?\" I asked innocently.    \"No. The Secret of the Lake was simply the sages' name forthe ageless technique of using positive images to influence themind. You can practice this method in your own living room oreven at the office if you really want to. Shut your door, hold all callsand close your eyes. Then take a few deep breaths. You will noticethat after two or three minutes you will start to feel relaxed. Next,visualize mental pictures of all that you want to be, to have and toattain in your life. If you want to be the world's best father,envision yourself laughing and playing with your kids, respondingto their questions with an open heart. Picture yourself actinggracefully and lovingly in a tense situation. Mentally rehearse theway you will govern your actions when a similar scene unfolds onthe canvas of reality.    \"The magic of visualization can be applied to so manysituations. You can use it to be more effective in court, to enhanceyour relationships and to develop yourself spiritually. Consistentuse of this method will also bring you financial rewards along withan abundance of material gain, if this is important to you.Understand once and for all that your mind has magnetic power toattract all that you desire into your life. If there is a lack in yourlife it is because there is a lack in your thoughts. Hold wonderfulpictures in your mind's eye. Even one negative image is poisonousto your mindset. Once you start to experience the joy this ancienttechnique brings, you will realize the infinite potential of yourmind and begin to liberate the storehouse of ability and energythat currently sleeps within you.\"     It was as if Julian was speaking a foreign tongue. I had neverheard anyone speak of the magnetic power of the mind to attractspiritual and material abundance. Nor had I ever heard anyonespeak of the power of imaging and its profound effects on everyaspect of one's world. Yet, deep inside I had faith in what Julianwas saying. This was a man whose judgment and intellectualabilities were impeccable. This was a man who was internationallyrespected for his legal acumen. This was a man who had walkeddown the path I was now journeying along. Julian had foundsomething on his odyssey to the East, that much was clear.Looking at his physical vitality, his obvious tranquility, seeing histransformation confirmed that I would be wise to listen to hisadvice.     The more I thought about what I was hearing the more senseit made. Surely the mind must have a great deal more potentialthan most of us are currently using. How else could mothers liftotherwise immovable cars to save their crying infants who hadfallen underneath? How else could martial artists break stacks ofbricks with one fell swoop of their hands? How else could the yogisof the East slow down their heartbeats at will or enduretremendous pain without blinking an eye? Maybe the real problemwas within me and my lack of belief in the gifts that every beingpossesses. Perhaps this evening sitting alongside a formermillionaire-lawyer turned monk of the Himalayas was a sort ofwake-up call for me to start making the most of my life.     \"But doing these exercises at the office, Julian?\" I responded.\"My partners think I'm strange enough as it is.\"      \"Yogi Raman and all the kind sages with whom he lived, oftenused a saying that had been passed down to them through thegenerations. It is my privilege to pass it on to you, on what hasbecome an important evening for both of us, if I may say so. Thewords are as follows: 'There is nothing noble about being superiorto some other person. True nobility lies in being superior to yourformer self.' All I'm really getting at is that if you want to improveyour life and live with all that you deserve you must run your ownrace. It doesn't matter what other people say about you. What isimportant is what you say to yourself. Do not be concerned withthe judgment of others as long as you know what you are doing isright. You can do whatever you want to do as long as it is correctaccording to your conscience and your heart. Never be ashamed ofdoing that which is right; decide on what you think is good andthen stick to it. And for God's sake, never get into the petty habitof measuring your self-worth against other people's net worth. AsYogi Raman preached: 'Every second you spend thinking aboutsomeone else's dreams you take time away from your own.'\"     It was now seven minutes past midnight. Remarkably, I didn'tfeel the least bit tired. When I shared this with Julian he smiledonce again. \"You have learned yet another principle forenlightened living. For the most part, fatigue is a creation of themind. Fatigue dominates the lives of those who are living withoutdirection and dreams. Let me give you an example. Have you everhad an afternoon at the office where you were reading your drycase reports and your mind started to wander and you started tofeel sleepy?\"     \"From time to time,\" I answered, not wishing to reveal the factthat this was my modus operandi. \"Sure, most of us feel drowsy atwork on a regular basis.\"     \"Yet, if a friend calls on the phone to ask you if you want to goout to the ball game that night or asks you for advice on his golfgame, I have no doubt that you would spring to life. Every trace ofyour fatigue would vanish. Is that a fair assessment?\"     \"That's fair, counselor.\"     Julian knew he was on a roll. \"So your tiredness was nothingmore then a mental creation, a bad habit your mind has cultivatedto act as a crutch when you are performing a tedious task. Tonightyou are obviously enchanted with my story and keen to learn thewisdom that has been revealed to me. Your interest and mentalfocus give you energy. This evening, your mind has not been in thepast nor has it been in the future. It has been squarely focused onthe present, on our conversation. When you consistently directyour mind to live in the present you will always have boundlessenergy, no matter what time the clock reflects.\"     I nodded my head in agreement. Julian's wisdom seemed soobvious and yet so much of it had never occurred to me. I guesscommon sense is not always so common. I thought about what myfather used to tell me when I was growing up: \"Only those whoseek shall find.\" I wished he was with me.Chapter 7 Action Summary • Julian's Wisdom in a Nutshell  T he S y m b ol  T he V i r t u e         Master Your Mind                           •   Cultivate your mind - it will blossom beyond your   T he W i s d om             expectations                           •   The quality of your life is determined by the quality of                               your thoughts                           •   There are no mistakes - only lessons.

McClellan\"The day that Yogi Raman shared his mystical little fable with me,high atop the Himalayas, was actually quite similar to this day inmany respects,\" said Julian.    \"Really?\"    \"Our meeting began in the evening and carried on well into thenight. There was such a chemistry between the two of us that theair seemed to crackle with electricity. As I mentioned to youearlier, from the first moment I met Raman, I felt as if he was thebrother I never had. Tonight, sitting here with you and enjoyingthe look of intrigue on your face, I feel the same energy and bond.I will also tell you that I have always thought of you as my littlebrother since we became friends, I'll tell you the truth, I saw a lotof myself in you.\"     \"You were an amazing litigator, Julian. I will never forget youreffectiveness.\"     It was obvious that he had no interest in exploring themuseum of his past.     \"John, I'd like to continue to share the elements of YogiRaman's fable with you, but before I do this, I must confirmsomething. Already you have learned a number of highlyeffective strategies for personal change which will do wondersfor you if you apply them consistently. I will open my heart to youtonight and reveal everything I know, as it is my duty to do. I justwant to make sure that you fully understand how important it isthat you, in turn, pass this wisdom on to all those who aresearching for such guidance. We are living in a very troubledworld. Negativity pervades it and many in our society arefloating like ships without rudders, weary souls searching for alighthouse that will keep them from crashing against the rockyshores. You must serve as a captain of sorts. I'm placing my trustin you to take the message of the Sages of Sivana to all those whoneed it.\"    After consideration, I promised Julian with conviction that Iwould accept this assignment. He then continued passionately.\"The beauty of the whole exercise is that as you strive to improvethe lives of others, your own life will be elevated into its highestdimensions. This truth is based on an ancient paradigm forextraordinary living.\"     \"I'm all ears.\"     \"Basically, the sages of the Himalayas guided their lives by asimple rule: he who serves the most, reaps the most, emotionally,physically, mentally and spiritually. This is the way to inner peaceand outer fulfillment.\"    I once read that people who study others are wise but thosewho study themselves are enlightened. Here, perhaps for the firsttime, I saw a man who truly knew himself, perhaps his highest self.In his austere clothing, with the half-smile of a youthful Buddhagracing his supple face, Julian Mantle appeared to have it all: idealhealth, happiness and an overriding sense of his role in thekaleidoscope of the universe. Yet, he owned nothing.     \"This brings me to the lighthouse,\" said Julian, remainingfocused on the task at hand.     \"I was wondering how that fit into Yogi Raman's fable.\"     \"I'll try to explain,\" he responded, sounding more like a well-schooled professor than a lawyer turned monk who had renouncedthe sensual world. \"You have now learned that the mind is like afertile garden and for it to flourish, you must nurture it daily.Never let the weeds of impure thought and action take the gardenof your mind. Stand guard at the gateway of your mind. Keep ithealthy and strong — it will work miracles in your life if you willonly let it.\"     \"You will recall that in the middle of the garden stood amagnificent lighthouse. This symbol will remind you of yet anotherancient principle for enlightened living: the purpose of life is a lifeof purpose. Those who are truly enlightened know what they wantout of life, emotionally, materially, physically and spiritually.Clearly defined priorities and goals for every aspect of your lifewill serve a role similar to that played by a lighthouse, offering youguidance and refuge when the seas become rough. You see, John,anyone can revolutionize their lives once they revolutionize thedirection in which they are moving. But if you don't even knowwhere you are going, how will you ever know when you get there?\"    Julian transported me back to the time when Yogi Ramanexamined this principle with him. He recalled the sage's exactwords. \"Life is funny,\" observed Yogi Raman. \"One would thinkthat the less one worked the more one would have the chance toexperience happiness. However, the real source of happiness canbe stated in a word: achievement. Lasting happiness comes fromsteadily working to accomplish your goals and advancingconfidently in the direction of your life's purpose. This is the secretto kindling the inner fire that lurks within you. I do understandthat it might seem more than a little ironic that you have travelledthousands of miles from your achievement-oriented society tospeak to a cluster of mystical sages living high in the Himalayasonly to learn that another eternal secret of happiness can be foundin achievement, but it is true.\"    \"Workaholic monks?\" I suggested playfully.    \"Quite the opposite. While the sages were tremendouslyproductive people, their productivity was not of the frenetic type.Instead, it was of the peaceful, focused, zen-like kind.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Everything they did had a purpose. Though they wereremoved from the modern world and lived a highly spiritualexistence, they were also highly effective. Some spent their dayspolishing off philosophical treatises, others created fabulous,richly textured poems which challenged their intellect andrenewed their creativity. Still others passed their time in thesilence of total contemplation, looking like illuminated statuesseated in the ancient lotus pose. The Sages of Sivana did not wastetime. Their collective conscience told them that their lives had apurpose and they had a duty to fulfill.     \"This is what Yogi Raman said to me: 'Here in Sivana wheretime appears to stand still, you might wonder what a group ofsimple, possessionless sages would ever need or hope to achieve.But achievement need not be of the material sort. Personally, myobjectives are to attain peace of mind, self-mastery andenlightenment. If I fail to accomplish these goals by the end of mylife, I am certain that I will die feeling unfulfilled and dissatisfied.'\"     Julian told me that that was the first time he had heard any ofhis teachers in Sivana speak of their own mortality. \"And YogiRaman sensed this in my expression. 'You need not worry, myfriend. I have already lived past the age of one hundred and haveno plans for a quick exit. My point is simply that when you clearlyknow what aims you wish to achieve over the course of your life, bethey material, emotional, physical or spiritual, and you spend yourdays accomplishing them, you will ultimately find eternal joy. Yourlife will be as delightful as mine — and you will come to know asplendid reality. But you must know your life's aim and thenmanifest this vision into reality by consistent action. We sages callthis Dharma, which is the Sanskrit word for life's purpose.\"     \"Lifelong contentment will come from the fulfillment of myDharma?\" I asked.     \"Most certainly. From Dharma springs inner harmony andlasting satisfaction. Dharma is based upon the ancient principle thatsays every one of us has a heroic mission whilst we walk this Earth.We have all been granted a unique set of gifts and talents that willreadily allow us to realize this lifework. The key is to discover them,and in doing so, discover the main objective of your life.\"     I interrupted Julian, \"It's sort of what you were saying earlierabout risk taking.\"     \"Maybe yes, maybe no.\"     \"I don't follow.\"     \"Yes, it may seem as though you are forced to take a few risksto discover what you are best at and the essence of your life'spurpose. Many people quit jobs that have stifled their progressthe moment they discover the true purpose of their existence.There is always the apparent risk that comes with self-examination and soul searching. But no, because there is never arisk in discovering yourself and the mission of your life. Self-knowledge is the DNA of self-enlightenment. It is a very good,indeed essential thing.\"    \"What is your Dharma, Julian?\" I asked casually, attemptingto mask my burning curiosity.    \"Mine is simple: to selflessly serve others. Remember, you willnot find true joy in sleeping, in relaxing or in spending your timelike an idler. As Benjamin Disraeli said: 'The secret of success isconstancy of purpose.' The happiness you are searching for comesthrough reflecting on the worthy aims you are dedicated toachieving and then taking action daily to advance them. This is adirect application of the timeless philosophy which prescribes thatthose things which are most important should never be sacrificedto those things which are the least important. The lighthouse inYogi Raman's fable will always remind you of the power of settingclearly defined, purposeful goals and, most importantly, of havingthe character power to act on them.\"    Over the course of the next few hours, I learned from Julianthat all highly developed, fully actualized people understand theimportance of exploring their talents, uncovering their personalpurpose and then applying their human gifts in the direction ofthis calling. Some people selflessly serve humanity as physicians,others as artists. Some people discover that they are powerfulcommunicators and become wonderful teachers, whilst otherscome to realize that their legacy will be in the form of innovationsin the field of business or science. The key is to have the disciplineand vision to see your heroic mission and to ensure that it servesother people while you realize it.     \"Is this a form of goal-setting?\"    \"Goal-setting is the starting point. Mapping out yourobjectives and your goals releases the creative juices which getyou on to the path of your purpose. Believe it or not, Yogi Ramanand the other sages were very hot on goals.\"     \"You're kidding. Highly effective monks living deep in theHimalayan mountains who meditate all night and set goals all day.I love it!\"     \"John, always judge by results. Look at me. Sometimes I don'teven recognize myself when I look in the mirror. My once-unfulfilling existence has been replaced by one rich with adventure,mystery and excitement. I am young again and enjoy vibrant health.I am truly happy. The wisdom I am sharing with you is so potent andso important and so life-giving that you simply must stay open to it.\"     \"I am Julian, I really am. Everything you have said makesperfect sense, although some of the techniques do sound a littleodd. But I have promised to try them and I will. I agree that thisinformation is powerful.\"     \"If I have seen farther than others, it is simply because I havestood on the shoulders of great teachers,\" replied Julian withhumility. \"Here's another example. Yogi Raman was an expertarcher, a true master. To illustrate his philosophy on theimportance of setting clearly defined objectives in every aspect ofone's life and fulfilling one's mission, he offered a demonstration Iwill never forget.    \"Near where we were sitting there was a magnificent oak tree.The sage pulled one of the roses from the garland he habituallywore and placed it on the center of the trunk. He then pulled threeobjects from the large knapsack that was his constant companionwhenever he ventured to distant mountain climes such as the onewe were visiting. The first object was his favorite bow, made of awonderfully fragrant yet sturdy sandalwood. The second item wasan arrow. The third object was a lily-white handkerchief — thekind I used to wear in the pocket of my expensive suits to impressjudges and juries,\" Julian added apologetically.    Yogi Raman then asked Julian to put the handkerchief over hiseyes as a blindfold.    \"How far away from the rose am I?\" Yogi Raman asked hispupil.    \"One hundred feet,\" Julian guessed.    \"Have you ever observed me in my daily practice of thisancient sport of archery?\" the sage queried, in full knowledge ofthe response that would come.    \"I have seen you strike the bull's-eye from a mark almostthree hundred feet away and I cannot recall a time that you haveever missed at your current distance,\" Julian noted dutifully.    Then, with his eyes covered by the cloth and his feet placedsecurely in the earth, the teacher drew the bow with all his energyand released the arrow — aiming directly at the rose hangingfrom the tree. The arrow struck the large oak with a thud, missingits mark by an embarrassingly large distance.    \"I thought you were going to display more of your magicalabilities, Yogi Raman. What happened?\"    \"We have travelled to this isolated place for one reason only Ihave agreed to reveal all my worldly wisdom to you. Today'sdemonstration is meant to reinforce my advice on the importanceof setting clearly defined objectives in your life and knowingprecisely where you are going. What you just saw confirms themost important principle for anyone seeking to attain their goalsand to fulfill their life's purpose: you will never be able to hit atarget that you cannot see. People spend their whole livesdreaming of becoming happier, living with more vitality and havingan abundance of passion. Yet they do not see the importance oftaking even ten minutes a month to write out their goals and tothink deeply about the meaning of their lives, their Dharma. Goal-setting will make your life magnificent. Your world will becomericher, more delightful and more magical.\"    \"You see, Julian, our ancestors have taught us that settingclearly defined objectives for what we desire in our mental,physical and spiritual world is critical to their realization. In theworld you came from, people set financial and material goals.There is nothing wrong with this, if this is what you value.However, to attain self-mastery and inner enlightenment, youmust set concrete objectives in other areas as well. Would itsurprise you to know that I have clearly defined objectives withrespect to the peace of mind I desire, the energy I bring to eachday and the love that I offer to all those around me? Goal-settingis not just for distinguished lawyers such as yourself who reside ina world full of material attractions. Anyone who wishes to improvethe quality of their inner as well as their outer worlds would dowell to take out a piece of paper and start writing out their lifeaims. At the very moment that this is done, natural forces willcome into play which start to transform these dreams into reality.\"    What I was hearing fascinated me. When I was a footballplayer in high school, my coach had constantly spoken of theimportance of knowing what we wanted from every game. \"Knowyour outcome,\" was his personal creed, and our team wouldn'tdream of stepping onto the playing field without a clear game planthat would lead us to victory. I wondered why, as I had grownolder, I had never taken the time to develop a game plan for myown life. Maybe Julian and Yogi Raman had something here.     \"What is so special about taking out a sheet of paper andwriting out your goals? How could such a simple act make such adifference?\" I asked.     Julian was delighted. \"Your obvious interest inspires me, John.Enthusiasm is one of the key ingredients for a lifetime of successfulliving and I am glad to see that you still have every ounce of yours.Earlier I taught you that we each think about 60,000 thoughts onan average day. By writing out your desires and goals on a piece ofpaper, you send a red flag to your subconscious mind that thesethoughts are far more important than the remaining 59,999 otherones. Your mind will then start to seek out all opportunities torealize your destiny like a guided missile. It is really a veryscientific process. Most of us are simply not aware of it.\"     \"A few of my partners are big on goal-setting. Come to thinkof it, they are the most financially successful people I know. But Idon't think they are the most balanced,\" I observed.     \"Perhaps they are not setting the right goals. You see, John,life pretty much gives you what you ask from it. Most people wantto feel better, have more energy or live with greater satisfaction.Yet, when you ask them to tell you precisely what it is they want,they have no answer. You change your life the moment you setyour goals and start to seek out your Dharma,\" Julian said, hiseyes sparkling with the truth of his words.    \"Have you ever met someone with a strange name and thenstarted to notice that name appearing everywhere: in newspapers,on the television or at the office? Or have you ever becomeinterested in a new subject, let's say fly fishing, and then noticedthat you couldn't go anywhere without hearing about the wondersof fly fishing? This is but one illustration of the ageless principleYogi Raman called joriki, which I have since learned means'concentrated mind.' Concentrate every ounce of your mentalenergy on self-discovery. Learn what you excel at and what makesyou happy. Maybe you are practicing law but are really meant tobe a school teacher, given your patience and love of teaching.Perhaps you are a frustrated painter or sculptor. Whatever it is,find your passion and then follow it.\"     \"Now that I really think about it, it would be sad to reach theend of my life without realizing that I had some special genius thatwould have unlocked my potential and helped others — even in asmall way.\"     \"That's right. So from this moment onwards, be acutely awareof your aim in life. Awaken your mind to the abundance ofpossibility around you. Start to live with more zest. The humanmind is the world's largest filtering device. When used properly itfilters out what you perceive as unimportant and gives you onlythe information you are looking for at that time. At this verymoment, as we sit here in your living room, there are hundreds ifnot thousands of things going on that we are not paying anyattention to. There is the sound of the lovers giggling as they strollalong the boardwalk, the goldfish in the tank behind you, the coolair being blown from the air conditioner and even the beat of myown heart. The moment I decide to concentrate on my heartbeat,I start to notice its rhythm and its qualities. Similarly, when youdecide to start concentrating your mind on your life's main aims,your mind starts to filter out the unimportant and focus only onthe important.\"    \"To tell you the truth, I think it's about time I discovered mypurpose,\" I said. \"Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of greatthings in my life. But it isn't as rewarding as I think it could be. IfI left this world today, I really can't say for sure that I've madethat big a difference.\"     \"How does that make you feel?\"     \"Depressed,\" I offered with total honesty. \"I know I havetalent. Actually, I was one heck of a good artist when I wasyounger. That was until the legal profession beckoned with thepromise of a more stable life.\"     \"Do you ever wish you had made painting your profession?\"     \"I really haven't given it much thought. But I will say onething. When I painted I was in Heaven.\"     \"It really fired you up, didn't it?\"     \"Absolutely. I lost track of time when I was in the studiopainting. I would get lost in the canvas. It was a real release forme. It was almost as if I transcended time and moved into anotherdimension.\"     \"John, this is the power of concentrating your mind on apursuit that you love. Goethe said that 'we are shaped andfashioned by what we love.' Maybe your Dharma is to brighten theworld with lovely scenes. At least start spending a little timepainting every day.\"     \"How about applying this philosophy to things less esotericthan changing my life?\" I asked with a grin.     \"This should be good.\" Julian replied. \"Like what?\"     \"Let's say one of my aims, although a minor one, was to drop the spare tire I am carrying around my waist. Where would I start?\"    \"Don't be embarrassed. You master the art of goal-setting —and goal getting — by starting off small.\"    \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step?\" Iasked intuitively.    \"Precisely. And getting good at accomplishing little featsprepares you for realizing the big ones. So, to answer your questionsquarely, there is nothing wrong with mapping out a full range ofsmaller goals in the process of planning your bigger ones.\"    Julian told me that the Sages of Sivana had created a five-stepmethod to reach their objectives and fulfill the purposes of theirlives. It was simple, practical and it worked. The first step was toform a clear mental image of the outcome. If this was to loseweight, Julian told me that every morning just after I woke up, Iwas to envision myself as a lean, fit person, full of vitality andboundless energy. The clearer this mental picture, the moreeffective the process would be. He said that the mind was theultimate treasure house of power and this simple act of \"picturing\"my goal would open the gateway to the actualization of this desire.Step two was to get some positive pressure on myself    \"The main reason people do not follow through on anyresolutions they make is that it is too easy to slip back into theirold ways. Pressure is not always a bad thing. Pressure can inspireyou to achieve great ends. People generally achieve magnificentthings when their backs are up against the wall and they areforced to tap into the wellspring of human potential that lieswithin them.\"    \"How can I create this 'positive pressure' on myself?\" I asked,now thinking about the possibilities of applying this method toeverything from getting up earlier to being a more patient andloving father.    \"There are a whole host of ways to do this. One of the best isthe public pledge. Tell everyone you know that you will lose theexcess weight or write that novel or whatever your goal might be.Once you make your goal known to the world, there will instantlybe pressure on you to work towards its fulfillment since no onelikes to look like a failure. In Sivana, my teachers used moredramatic means to create this positive pressure I speak of. Theywould declare to one another that if they did not follow through ontheir commitments, such as fasting for a week or getting up dailyat 4:00 a.m. to meditate, they would go down to the icy waterfalland stand under it until their arms and legs went numb. This is anextreme illustration of the power that pressure can exert on thebuilding of good habits and the attainment of goals.\"     \"'Extreme' might be an understatement, Julian. What abizarre ritual!\"     \"Extremely effective though. The point is simply that whenyou train your mind to associate pleasure with good habits andpunishment with bad ones, your weaknesses will quickly fall bythe wayside.\"     \"You said there were five steps to follow to make my desirescome true.\" I said impatiently. \"What are the remaining three?\"      \"Yes, John. Step one is to have a clear vision of your outcome.Step two is to create positive pressure to keep you inspired. Thethird step is a simple one: never set a goal without attaching atimeline to it. To breathe life into a goal you must attach a precisedeadline to it. It's just like when you are preparing cases for court;you always focus your attention on the ones the judge hasscheduled to be heard tomorrow rather than on the ones withoutany court date.     \"Oh, and by the way,\" explained Julian, \"remember that a goalthat is not committed to paper is no goal at all. Go out and buy ajournal — a cheap coil notepad will do. Call this your Dream Bookand fill it with all your desires, objectives and dreams. Get to knowyourself and what you are all about.\"     \"Don't I already know myself?\"     \"Most people don't. They have never taken the time to knowtheir strengths, their weaknesses, their hopes, their dreams. TheChinese define image in these terms: there are three mirrors thatform a person's reflection; the first is how you see yourself, thesecond is how others see you and the third mirror reflects thetruth. Know yourself, John. Know the truth.     \"Divide your Dream Book into separate sections for goalsrelating to the different areas of your life. For example you mighthave sections for your physical fitness goals, your financial goals,your personal empowerment goals, your relationship and socialgoals and, perhaps most importantly, your spiritual goals.\"     \"Hey, that sounds like fun! I've never thought about doing something as creative as that for myself I really should startchallenging myself more,\" I said.     \"I agree. Another particularly effective technique I learned isto fill your Dream Book with pictures of the things you desire andimages of people who have cultivated the abilities, talents and qualities that you hope to emulate. Getting back to you and your 'spare tire,' if you want to lose weight and be in outstanding physical shape, paste a picture of a marathon runner or an elite athlete in your Dream Book. If you want to be the world's finest husband, why not clip out a picture of someone who represents this— perhaps your father — and put it into your journal in the relationship section. If you are dreaming of a mansion by the sea or a sports car, find an inspiring picture of these objects and usethem for your book of dreams. Then review this book daily, evenfor a few minutes. Make it your friend. The results will startle you.\"      \"This is pretty revolutionary stuff, Julian. I mean, though theseideas have been around for centuries, everybody I know todaycould improve the quality of their daily lives by applying even a fewof them. My wife would love to have a Dream Book. She'd probablyfill it with pictures of me without my notorious belly.\"      \"It's really not that big,\" Julian suggested in a consoling tone.      \"Then why does Jenny call me Mr. Donut?\" I said, breakinginto a broad smile.      Julian started to laugh. I had to follow. Soon the two of us werehowling on the floor.      \"I guess if you can't laugh at yourself who can you laugh at?\"I said, still giggling.      \"Very true, my friend. When I was chained to my formerlifestyle, one of my main problems was that I took life tooseriously. Now I am much more playful and childlike. I enjoy all oflife's gifts, no matter how small they are.\"      \"But I have digressed. I have so much to tell you and it is allflowing out of me at once.\"      \"Back to the five-step method to attain your aims and realizeyour goals. Once you have formed a clear mental picture of youroutcome, created a little pressure behind it, set a deadline andcommitted it to paper, the next step is to apply what Yogi Ramancalled The Magic Rule of 21. The learned men and women of hisworld believed that, for new behavior to crystallize into a habit,one had to perform the new activity for twenty-one days in a row.\"       \"What's so special about twenty-one days?\"       \"The sages were absolute masters of creating new, morerewarding habits which governed the conduct of their lives. YogiRaman once told me that a bad habit once acquired could never beerased.\"     \"But all evening you have been inspiring me to change the wayI live my life. How can I possibly do this if I can never erase any ofmy bad habits?\"     \"I said that bad habits can never be erased. I did not say thatnegative habits could not be replaced,\" Julian noted with precision.     \"Oh Julian, you always were the King of Semantics. But Ithink I see your point.\"     \"The only way to permanently install a new habit is to direct somuch energy toward it that the old one slips away like anunwelcome house guest. The installation is generally complete inabout twenty-one days, the time it takes to create a new neuralpathway.\"     \"Say I wanted to start practicing the Heart of the Rosetechnique to erase the worry habit and live at a more peacefulpace. Do I have to do it at the same time every day?\"     \"Good question. The first thing I will tell you is that you neverhave to do anything. Everything I am sharing with you tonight Iam offering as a friend who is genuinely interested in your growthand development. Every strategy, tool and technique has beentested over time for effectiveness and measurable results. This Iassure you. And though my heart tells me that I should imploreyou to try all of the methods of the sages, my conscience tells meto simply follow my duty and share the wisdom with you, leavingits implementation up to you. My point is this: never do anythingbecause you have to. The only reason to do something is becauseyou want to and because you know it is the right thing for you to do.\"     \"Sounds reasonable, Julian. Don't worry, I haven't felt for evena moment that you were forcing any of this information down mythroat. Anyway, the only thing that could ever be forced down mythroat these days would be a box of donuts — and that wouldn'ttake much,\" I quipped.    Julian smiled gingerly. \"Thanks pal. Now to answer yourquestion, my suggestion is that you try the Heart of the Rosemethod at the same time every day and in the same place, everyday. There is tremendous power in a ritual. Sports stars who eatthe same meal or tie their shoes the same way before the big gameare tapping into the power of ritual. Members of a church whoperform the same rites, wear the same robes, are using the powerof ritual. Even business people who walk the same route or talkthe same talk before a big presentation are applying the power ofritual. You see, when you insert any activity into your routine bydoing it the same way at the same time every day, it quickly growsinto a habit.\"    \"For example, most people will do the same thing upon wakingup, without giving any thought to what they are doing. They opentheir eyes, get out of bed, walk to the bathroom and start brushingtheir teeth. So, staying with your goal for a period of twenty-onedays, and performing the new activity at the same time for each ofthese days, will insert it into your routine. Soon you will beperforming the new habit, whether it is meditation, getting upearlier or reading for an hour every day, with the same ease thatyou feel while brushing your teeth.\"    \"The final step for attaining goals and advancing along thepath of purpose?\"    \"The final step in the sages' method is one that is equallyapplicable as you advance along the path of your life.\"    \"My cup is still empty,\" I said respectfully.    \"Enjoy the process. The Sages of Sivana often spoke of thisphilosophy. They truly believed that a day without laughter or aday without love was a day without life.\"    \"I'm not sure I follow you.\"    \"All I'm saying is make sure that you have fun while you areadvancing along the path of your goals and purpose. Never forgetthe importance of living with unbridled exhilaration. Neverneglect to see the exquisite beauty in all living things. Today andthis very moment that you and I are sharing is a gift. Remainspirited, joyful and curious. Stay focused on your lifework and ongiving selfless service to others. The Universe will take care ofeverything else. This is one of nature's truest laws.\"    \"And never regret what has happened in the past?\"    \"Exactly. There is no chaos in this Universe. There is apurpose for everything that has ever happened to you, andeverything that will happen to you. Remember what I told you,John. Every experience offers lessons. So stop majoring in minorthings. Enjoy your life.\"    \"Is that it?\"    \"I still have much wisdom to share with you. Are you tired?\"    \"Not in the least. Actually I feel pretty pumped up. You arequite the motivator, Julian. Have you ever thought about aninfomercial?\" I asked mischievously.    \"I don't understand,\" he replied gently.    \"Never mind. Just one of my feeble attempts at humor.\"    \"Okay. Before we move along with Yogi Raman's fable, there isone last point about reaching your goals and your dreams that Iwould like to impress on you.\"    \"Go for it.\"    \"There is one word which the sages spoke of in almostreverential terms.\"     \"Do tell.\"     \"This simple word seemed to carry a depth of meaning forthem and it peppered their daily talk. The word I am speaking of ispassion, and it is a word you must constantly keep at the forefrontof your mind as you follow your mission and attain your goals. Aburning sense of passion is the most potent fuel for your dreams.Here, in our society we have lost our passion. We do not do thingsbecause we love to do them. We do things because we feel we haveto do them. This is a formula for misery. And I am not speaking ofromantic passion, although this is another ingredient for asuccessful, inspired existence. What I am talking about is a passionfor life. Reclaim the joy of waking up every morning, full of energyand exhilaration. Breathe the fire of passion into all that you do.You will quickly reap great material, as well as spiritual, rewards.\"     \"You make it sound so easy.\"     \"It is. From tonight onwards, take complete control of yourlife. Decide, once and for all, to be the master of your fate. Runyour own race. Discover your calling and you will start toexperience the ecstacy of an inspired life. Finally, alwaysremember that what lies behind you and what lies in front of youis nothing when compared to what lies within you.\"     \"Thanks Julian. I really needed to hear this.

CHAPTER NINE              The Ancient Art of                Self-Leadership           Good people strengthen themselves ceaselessly.                                                     Confucius\"Time is passing quickly,\" said Julian before pouring himselfanother cup of tea. \"The morning will soon be upon us. Do youwant me to continue or have you had enough for one night?\"    There was no way that I was going to let this man, who heldsuch gems of wisdom within his grasp, stop without completing hisstory. At the outset, his tale seemed fantastic. But as I listened tohim, as I absorbed the ageless philosophy that had been bestowedupon him, I came to believe deeply in what he was saying. Thesewere not the superficial self-serving ruminations of some two-bithuckster. Julian was the real thing. He clearly walked his talk. Andhis message rang true. I trusted him.    \"Please continue, Julian, I have all the time in the world. Thekids are sleeping at their grandparents' house tonight, and Jennywon't be up for hours.\"     Sensing my sincerity, he continued with the symbolic fable thatYogi Raman had offered him to illustrate his wisdom on cultivatinga richer, more radiant life.     \"I have told you that the garden represents the fertile gardenof your mind, a garden that is filled with delightful treasures andboundless riches. I have also spoken of the lighthouse and how itrepresents the power of goals and the importance of discoveringyour calling in life. You will recall that as the fable continues, thedoor of the lighthouse slowly opens and out walks a nine-foot-tall,nine-hundred-pound Japanese sumo wrestler.\"     \"Sounds like a bad Godzilla movie.\"     \"I used to love those when I was a kid.\"     \"Me too. But don't let me distract you,\" I replied.     \"The sumo wrestler represents a very important element inthe life-changing system of the Sages of Sivana. Yogi Raman toldme that many centuries ago in the ancient East, the great teachersdeveloped and refined a philosophy called kaizen. This Japaneseword means constant and never-ending improvement. And it's thepersonal trademark of every man and woman who is living asoaring, fully awakened existence.\"     \"How did the concept of kaizen enrich the lives of the sages?\"I asked.     \"As I mentioned earlier, John, success on the outside beginswith success on the inside. If you really want to improve your outerworld, whether this means your health, your relationships or yourfinances, you must first improve your inner world. The mosteffective way to do this is through the practice of continuous self-improvement. Self-mastery is the DNA of life mastery.\"     \"Julian, I hope you don't mind me saying it, but all this talkabout one's 'inner world' sounds more than a little esoteric to me.Remember, I'm just a middle-class lawyer from the leafy suburbswith a minivan sitting in the driveway and a Lawn-Boy in thegarage.     \"Look. Everything you have told me so far makes sense. As amatter of fact, much of what you have shared with me appears tobe common sense, although I know that common sense is anythingbut common in this day and age. I must tell you though, I'm havinga little difficulty with this notion of kaizen and improving my innerworld. What exactly are we talking about here?\"     Julian was agile in his response. \"In our society, we all toooften label the ignorant as weak. However, those who expresstheir lack of knowledge and seek instruction find the path toenlightenment before anyone else. Your questions are honest andshow me that you are open to fresh ideas. Change is the mostpowerful force in our society today. Most people fear it, the wiseembrace it. Zen tradition speaks of a beginner's mind: those whokeep their minds open to new concepts — those whose cups arealways empty — will always move to higher levels of achievementand fulfillment. Never be reluctant to ask even the most basic ofquestions. Questions are the most effective method of elicitingknowledge.\"    \"Thanks. But I still am unclear about kaizen.\"    \"When I speak of improving your inner world, I am simplyspeaking of self-improvement and personal expansion and it is thebest thing you can do for yourself. You might think that you are toobusy to spend time working on yourself. This would be a very bigmistake. You see, when you have taken the time to build a strongcharacter full of discipline, energy, power and optimism, you canhave anything and do anything you want in your outer world.When you have cultivated a deep sense of faith in your abilities andan indomitable spirit, nothing can stop you from succeeding in allyour pursuits and living with great rewards. Taking the time tomaster your mind, to care for the body and to nourish your soulwill put you in a position to develop more richness and vitality inyour life. It is as Epictetus said so many years ago: 'No man is freewho is not a master of himself.'\"     \"So kaizen is actually a very practical concept.\"     \"Very. Think about it, John. How could a person possibly leada corporation if he cannot even lead himself? How could younurture a family if you haven't learned to nurture and care foryourself? How could you possibly do good if you don't even feelgood? Do you see my point?\"     I nodded in full agreement. This was the first time I had givenany serious thought to the importance of improving myself. I hadalways thought that all those people I would see on the subwayreading books with titles like The Power of Positive Thinking orMegaLiving! were troubled souls desperate for some form ofmedicine to get them back on course. Now I realized that thosewho took the time to strengthen themselves were the strongestand that it was only through improving one's self that one couldever hope to improve the lot of others. I then started to reflect onall the things I could improve. I really could use the added energyand good health that exercising would surely bring. Riddingmyself of my nasty temper and my habit of interrupting othersmight do wonders for my relationship with my wife and kids. Anderasing my worry habit would give me the peace of mind and deephappiness I had been searching for. The more I thought about it,the more potential improvements I saw.    As I started to see all the positive things that would flood intomy life through the cultivation of good habits, I grew excited. ButI realized that Julian was talking about far more than theimportance of daily exercise, a healthful diet and a balancedlifestyle. What he had learned in the Himalayas was deeper andmore meaningful than this. He spoke of the importance of buildingstrength of character, developing mental toughness and livingwith courage. He told me that these three attributes would leadone not only to a virtuous life but to a life filled with achievement,satisfaction and inner peace. Courage was a quality everyonecould cultivate and one that would pay huge dividends over thelong run.     \"What does courage have to do with self-leadership andpersonal development?\" I wondered aloud.     \"Courage allows you to run your own race. Courage allows youto do whatever you want to do because you know that it is right.Courage gives you the self-control to persist where others havefailed. Ultimately, the degree of courage you live with determinesthe amount of fulfillment you receive. It allows you to truly realizeall the exquisite wonders of the epic that is your life. And thosewho master themselves have an abundance of courage.\"    \"Okay. I am starting to understand the power of working onmyself. Where do I start?\"    Julian returned to his conversation with Yogi Raman high atopthe mountains, on what he remembered as a remarkably starryand gloriously beautiful night.    \"Initially, I too had trouble with the notion of self-improvement. After all, I was a tough, Harvard-trained legalgunslinger who had no time for New Age theories forced on me bywhat I thought were people with bad haircuts who hung out atairports. I was wrong. It was this close-mindedness that washolding my life back all of those years. The more I listened to YogiRaman and the more I reflected on the pain and suffering of myformer world, the more I welcomed the philosophy of kaizen,constant and never-ending enrichment of the mind, body and soul,into my new life,\" Julian asserted.     \"Why am I hearing so much about the 'mind, body and soul'these days? It seems I can't even turn on the tube withoutsomeone making mention of it.\"     \"This is the trilogy of your human endowments. To improveyour mind without the cultivation of your physical gifts would be avery hollow victory. Elevating your mind and body to their highestlevel without nurturing your soul would leave you feeling veryempty and unfulfilled. But when you dedicate your energies tounlocking the full potential of all three of your humanendowments, you will taste the divine ecstacy of an enlightenedlife.\"    \"You've got me pretty excited, pal.\"    \"As to your question about where to start, I promise that I willgive you a number of ancient yet powerful techniques in a fewmoments. But first I must share a practical illustration with you.Get into push-up position.\"    'Good grief, Julian's become a drill sergeant,' I silentlythought. Being curious and wishing to keep my cup empty, Icomplied.    \"Now do as many push-ups as you can possibly do. Don't stopuntil you truly are certain that you cannot do any more.\"    I struggled with the exercise, my two-hundred-and-fifteen-pound frame not being used to much more than walking to thenearest McDonald's with my kids or meandering through a roundof golf with my law partners. The first fifteen push-ups were pureagony. With the heat of that summer evening adding to mydiscomfort, I started to sweat profusely. However, I wasdetermined not to show any signs of weakness and carried on untilmy vanity started to give way along with my arms. At twenty-three push-ups I gave up.     \"No more, Julian. This is killing me. What are you trying to dohere?\"     \"Are you certain that you can't do any more?\"     \"I'm sure. C'mon, give me a break. The only lesson I'm goingto learn from this is what to do for a heart attack.\"     \"Do ten more. Then you can rest,\" commanded Julian.     \"You've got to be kidding!\"     But I continued. One. Two. Five. Eight. And finally ten. I layon the floor in total exhaustion.     \"I went through precisely the same experience with YogiRaman the night he shared his special fable with me,\" said Julian.\"He told me that pain was a great teacher.\"     \"What could anyone possibly learn from an experience likethis?\" I asked breathlessly.     \"Yogi Raman, and all of the Sages of Sivana for that matter,believed that people grow the most when they enter the Zone ofthe Unknown.\"     \"Okay. But what does that have to do with making me do allthose push-ups?\"     \"You told me after you had done twenty-three that youcouldn't do any more. You told me that this was your absolutelimit. Yet, when I challenged you to do more, you responded withanother ten push-ups. You had more inside you and when youreached for your resources, you received more. Yogi Ramanexplained a fundamental truth to me whilst I was his student: 'Theonly limits on your life are those that you set yourself.' When youdare to get out of your circle of comfort and explore the unknown,you start to liberate your true human potential. This is the firststep towards self-mastery and mastery over every othercircumstance in your life. When you push beyond your limits, justas you did in this little demonstration, you unlock mental andphysical reserves that you never thought you had.\"    'Fascinating,' I thought. Come to think of it, I had recentlyread in a book that the average person uses only a minute measureof his human capacity. I wondered what we could do if we startedusing the remaining reservoir of our abilities.    Julian sensed he was on a roll.    \"You practice the art of kaizen by pushing yourself daily.Work hard to improve your mind and body. Nourish your spirit.Do the things you fear. Start to live with unbridled energy andlimitless enthusiasm. Watch the sun rise. Dance in a rain shower.Be the person you dream of being. Do the things you have alwayswanted to do but didn't because you tricked yourself intobelieving that you were too young, too old, too rich or too poor.Prepare to live a soaring, fully alive life. In the East they say thatluck favors the prepared mind. I believe that life favors theprepared mind.\"    Julian continued his passionate discourse. \"Identify the thingsthat are holding you back. Are you scared of speaking or do youhave trouble in your relationships? Do you lack a positive attitudeor do you need more energy? Make a written inventory of yourweaknesses. Satisfied people are far more thoughtful than others.Take the time to reflect on what it is that might be keeping youfrom the life you really want and know deep down you can have.Once you have identified what your weaknesses are, the next stepis to face them head on and attack your fears. If you fear publicspeaking, sign up to give twenty speeches. If you fear starting anew business or getting out of a dissatisfying relationship, musterevery ounce of your inner resolve and do it. This might be the firsttaste of real freedom that you have experienced in years. Fear isnothing more than a mental monster you have created, a negativestream of consciousness.\"      \"Fear is nothing more than a negative stream of consciousness?I like that. You mean all my fears are nothing more than imaginarylittle gremlins that have crept into my mind over the years?\"      \"Exactly, John. Every time they have prevented you fromtaking some action, you have added fuel to their fire. But when youconquer your fears, you conquer your life.\"     \"I need an example.\"     \"Sure. Let's take public speaking, an activity most people fearmore than death itself. When I was a litigator, I actually sawlawyers who were scared of stepping into court. They would doanything, including settling their client's otherwise worthy casesjust to avoid the pain of getting up on their feet inside a packedcourtroom.\"     \"I've seen them too.\"     \"Do you actually think that they were born with this fear?\"     \"I sure hope not.\"     \"Study a baby. She has no limits. Her mind is a lush landscapeof potential and possibility. Properly cultivated, it will lead her togreatness. Filled with negativity, it will lead her to mediocrity, atbest. What I am saying is this: no experience, whether it is publicspeaking or asking your boss for a raise or swimming in a sun-soaked lake or walking along the beach on a moonlit night, isinherently painful or pleasant. It is your thinking that makes it so.\"     \"Interesting.\"     \"A baby could be trained to view a glorious sunny day asdepressing. A child could be trained to see a puppy as a viciousanimal. An adult could be trained to see a drug as a pleasantvehicle for release. It's all a matter of conditioning, isn't it?\"     \"Sure.\"     \"The same holds true of fear. Fear is a conditioned response: alife-sucking habit that can easily consume your energy, creativityand spirit if you are not careful. When fear rears its ugly head,beat it down quickly. The best way to do that is to do the thing youfear. Understand the anatomy of fear. It is your own creation. Likeany other creation, it is just as easy to tear it down as it is to erectit. Methodically search for and then destroy every fear that hassecretly slid into the fortress of your mind. This alone will give youenormous confidence, happiness and peace of mind.\"     \"Can a person's mind actually be fully fearless?\" I asked.     \"Great question. The answer is an unequivocal and emphatic'Yes!' Each and every one of the Sages of Sivana was absolutelyfearless. You could see it in the way they walked. You could see itin the way they talked. You could see it when you looked deep intotheir eyes and I'll tell you something else, John.\"     \"What,\" I asked, fascinated by what I was hearing.     \"I too am fearless. I know myself and I have come to see thatmy natural state is one of indomitable strength and unlimitedpotential. It was just that I was blocked by all those years of self-neglect and unbalanced thinking. I'll tell you another thing. Whenyou erase fear from your mind, you start to look younger and yourhealth becomes more vibrant.\"     'Ah, the old mind-body connection,\" I replied, hoping to maskmy ignorance.     \"Yes. The sages of the East have known about it for over fivethousand years. Hardly 'new age,'\" he said, with a broad grinlighting up his radiant face.     \"The sages shared another powerful principle with me whichI think about often. I think it will be invaluable to you as you walkthe path of self-leadership and personal mastery. It has given memotivation at times when I feel like taking things easy. Thephilosophy can be stated succinctly: what sets highly actualizedpeople apart from those who never live inspired lives is that theydo those things that less developed people don't like doing—eventhough they might not like doing them either.     \"Truly enlightened people, those who experience deephappiness daily, are prepared to put off short-term pleasure forthe sake of long-term fulfillment. So they tackle their weaknessesand fears head on, even if dipping into the zone of the unknownbrings with it a measure of discomfort. They resolve to live by thewisdom of kaizen, improving every aspect of themselvesceaselessly and continuously. With time, things that were oncedifficult become easy. Fears that once prevented them from all thehappiness, health and prosperity they deserved fall to the waysidelike stickmen toppled by a hurricane.\"     \"So you're suggesting that I must change myself before Ichange my life?\"     \"Yes. It's like that old story my favorite professor told mewhen I was in law school. One night a father was relaxing with hisnewspaper after a long day at the office. His son, who wanted toplay, kept on pestering him. Finally, fed up, the father ripped out apicture of the globe that was in the paper and tore it into ahundred tiny pieces. 'Here son, go ahead and try to put this backtogether.' he said, hoping that this would keep the little boy busylong enough for him to finish reading his paper. To his amazement,his son returned after only one minute with the globe perfectlyback together. When the startled father asked how he achievedthis feat, the son smiled gently and replied 'Dad, on the other sideof the globe there was a picture of a person, and once I got theperson together, the world was okay.'\"    \"That's a great story.\"    \"You see John, the wisest people I have ever met, from theSages of Sivana to my professors at Harvard Law School, all seemto know the key formula for happiness.\"    \"Do continue,\" I said with a hint of impatience.    \"It's precisely what I said earlier: happiness comes through theprogressive realization of a worthy objective. When you are doingwhat you truly love to do you are bound to find deep contentment.\"    \"If happiness comes to everyone who simply does what theylove doing, why are so many people miserable?\"    \"Fair point, John. Doing what you love, whether this meansgiving up the work you are presently doing to become an actor orspending less time on those things that are less important to maketime for those things that are more meaningful, requires a greatdeal of courage. It requires you to step out of your comfort zone.And change is always a little uncomfortable at first. It is also morethan a little risky. Having said this, this is the surest way to designa more joyful life.\"    \"Exactly how does one go about building courage?\"   \"It's the same as the story: once you get yourself together,your world will be okay. Once you master your mind, body andcharacter, happiness and abundance will flow into your life almostmagically. But you must spend some time daily working onyourself, even if for only ten or fifteen minutes.\"     \"And what does the nine-foot-tall, nine-hundred-poundJapanese sumo wrestler symbolize in Yogi Raman's fable?\"     \"Our hefty friend will be your constant reminder of the powerof kaizen, the Japanese word for constant self-expansion andprogress.\"     In just a few hours, Julian had revealed the most powerful —and the most astonishing — information that I had ever heard inmy lifetime. I had learned of the magic in my own mind and itstreasure trove of potential. I had learned highly practicaltechniques to still the mind and focus its power on my desires anddreams. I had learned the importance of having a definite purposein life and of setting clear goals in every aspect of my personal,professional and spiritual world. Now I had been exposed to theageless principle of self-mastery: kaizen.    \"How can I practice the art of kaizen?\"    \"I will give you ten ancient yet supremely effective rituals thatwill lead you far along the path of personal mastery. If you applythem on a daily basis, with faith in their utility, you will observeremarkable results in just one month from today. If you continueto apply them, incorporating the techniques into your routine suchthat they become habits, you are bound to reach a state of perfecthealth, limitless energy, lasting happiness and peace of mind.Ultimately, you will reach your divine destiny — for this is yourbirthright.\"    \"Yogi Raman offered the ten rituals to me with great faith inwhat he termed their 'exquisiteness' and I think you will agreethat I am living proof of their power. I simply ask that you listento what I have to say and judge the results for yourself.\"    \"Life-changing results in only thirty days?\" I asked indisbelief.    \"Yes. The quid pro quo is that you must set aside at least onehour a day for thirty consecutive days to practice the strategies Iam about to offer to you. This investment in yourself is all it takes.And please don't tell me that you don't have the time.\"    \"But I don't,\" I said honestly. \"My practice is really booming. Idon't have ten minutes to myself, let alone a full hour, Julian.\"    \"As I told you, saying that you do not have the time to improveyourself, whether this means improving your mind or nourishingyour spirit, is much like saying you do not have time to stop for gasbecause you are too busy driving. Eventually it will catch up withyou.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Really.\"    \"How so?\"    \"Let me put it this way. You are very much like a high-performance race car worth millions of dollars; a well-oiled, highlysophisticated machine.\"    \"Why thank you Julian.\"    \"Your mind is the greatest wonder of the universe and yourbody has the capacity to perform feats that might astonish you.\"    \"Agreed.\"    \"Knowing the value of this high performance multi-milliondollar machine, would it be wise to run it full out every minute ofevery day without taking a pit stop to let the motor cool down?\"    \"Of course not.\"    \"Well then, why are you not taking some time every day foryour personal pit stop or rest break? Why are you not taking thetime to cool down the high performance engine of your mind? Doyou see my point? Taking the time to renew yourself is the mostimportant thing you can do. Ironically, taking time out from yourhectic schedule for self-improvement and personal enrichmentwill dramatically improve your effectiveness once you get backinto it.\"     \"One hour a day for thirty days is all it takes?\"     \"It's the magic formula I was always searching for. I wouldprobably have paid a couple of million dollars for it in my old glorydays, if I had understood its importance. Little did I know that itwas free, as is all priceless knowledge. Having said this, you mustbe disciplined and apply the strategies which make up the formuladaily, with utter conviction in their value.\"     \"This is not a quick-fix type deal. Once you are in, you are in itfor the long term.\"     \"What do you mean?\"     \"Spending one hour a day tending to yourself will surely giveyou dramatic results in thirty days — provided you do the rightthings. It takes about one month to fully install a new habit. Afterthis period, the strategies and techniques you will learn will fit likea second skin. The key is that you must keep on practicing themevery day if you want to keep on seeing the results.\"     \"Fair enough,\" I agreed. Julian clearly had unlocked awellspring of personal vitality and inner serenity in his own life.Actually, his transformation from a sickly old litigator to a radiant,energetic philosopher was nothing less than miraculous. At thatmoment I resolved to dedicate one hour a day to implementing thetechniques and principles I was about to hear. I decided to work onimproving myself before working to change others, as had been myhabit. Maybe I too could undergo a \"Mantle-like\" transformation.It was surely worth a try.     That night, sitting on the floor of my cluttered living room, Ilearned what Julian called \"The Ten Rituals of Radiant Living.\"Some of them required a little concentrated effort on my part.Others could be performed effortlessly. All were intriguing andrich with the promise of extraordinary things to come.      \"The first strategy was known to the sages as the Ritual ofSolitude. This involves nothing more than ensuring that your dailyschedule includes a mandatory period of peace.\"      \"Just what is a period of peace?\"      \"It is a period of time, as little as fifteen minutes or as much asfifty, wherein you explore the healing power of silence and come toknow who you really are,\" Julian explained.      \"Sort of a rest break for that overheated engine of mine?\" Isuggested with a slight smile.      \"That's a pretty accurate way of looking at it. Have you everbeen on a long road trip with your family?\"      \"Sure. Every summer we drive down to the islands to spend acouple of weeks with Jenny's parents.\"      \"Okay. Do you ever make pit-stops along the way?\"      \"Yes. For food, or if I'm feeling a little sleepy I'll take a quicknap after having listened to my kids fight in the back seat for sixhours.\"      \"Well, think of the Ritual of Solitude as a pit-stop for the soul.Its purpose is self-renewal and this is accomplished by spendingtime alone, immersed in the beautiful blanket of silence.\"      \"What is so special about silence?\"      \"Good question. Solitude and quiet connects you to yourcreative source and releases the limitless intelligence of theUniverse. You see, John, the mind is like a lake. In our chaoticworld, most people's minds are not still. We are full of innerturbulence. However, by simply taking the time to be still andquiet every day, the lake of the mind becomes as smooth as a plateof glass. This inner quietness brings with it a wealth of benefitsincluding a deep sense of well-being, inner peace and boundlessenergy. You will even sleep better and enjoy a renewed feeling ofbalance in your day-to-day activities.\"     \"Where should I go for this period of peace?\"     \"Theoretically, you could do it anywhere, from your bedroom toyour office. The key is to find a place of true quiet — and beauty.\"     \"How does beauty fit into the equation?\"     \"Beautiful images soothe a ruffled soul,\" Julian observed witha deep sigh. \"A bouquet of roses or a simple, solitary daffodil willhave a highly salutary effect on your senses and relax you no end.Ideally, you should savor such beauty in a space that will serve asa Sanctuary of the Self.\"     \"What's that?\"     \"Basically, it is a place that will become your secret forum formental and spiritual expansion. This might be a spare room inyour house or simply a peaceful corner of a small apartment. Thepoint is to reserve a spot for your renewal activities, a place thatsits there quietly awaiting your arrival.\"     \"I love the sound of that. I think having a silent place to go towhen I come home from work would make a world of difference. Icould decompress for a while and let go of the stresses of the dayIt would probably make me a much nicer person to be around.\"     \"That brings up another important point. The Ritual ofSolitude works best when you practice it at the same time everyday.\"     \"Why?\"     \"Because then it becomes integrated into your routine as aritual. By practicing it at the same time every day, a daily dose ofsilence will soon become a habit that you will never neglect. Andpositive life habits inevitably guide you to your destiny.\"     \"Anything else?\"     \"Yes. If at all possible, commune with nature daily. A quickwalk through the woods or even a few minutes spent cultivatingyour tomato garden in the backyard will reconnect you to thewellspring of calm that may now be dormant within you. Beingwith nature also allows you to tune in to the infinite wisdom of yourhighest self. This self-knowledge will move you into the uncharteddimensions of your personal power. Never forget this,\" advisedJulian, his voice rising with passion.     \"Has this ritual worked well for you, Julian?\"     \"Absolutely. I rise with the sun and the first thing I do is headoff to my secret sanctuary. There I explore the Heart of the Rosefor as long as need be. Some days I spend hours in quietcontemplation. On other days I spend only ten minutes. The resultis more or less the same: a deep sense of inner harmony and anabundance of physical energy. Which brings me to the secondritual. This is the Ritual of Physicality.\"     \"Sounds interesting. What's it about?\"     \"It's about the power of physical care.\"     \"Huh?\"     \"It's simple. The Ritual of Physicality is based on the principlethat says as you care for the body so you care for the mind. As youprepare your body, so you prepare your mind. As you train yourbody, so you train your mind. Take some time every single day tonourish the temple of your body through vigorous exercise. Getyour blood circulating and your body moving. Did you know thatthere are 168 hours in a week?\"     \"No, not really.\"      \"It's true. At least five of those hours should be invested insome form of physical activity. The Sages of Sivana practiced theancient discipline of yoga to awaken their physical potential andlive a strong, dynamic existence. It was an extraordinary sight tosee these marvellous physical specimens who had managed toage-proof their lives standing on their heads in the center of theirvillage!\"     \"Have you tried yoga, Julian? Jenny started practicing it lastsummer and says it has added five years to her life.\"     \"There is no one strategy that will magically transform yourlife, John, let me be the first to say this. Lasting and profoundchange comes through the continued application of a number ofthe methods I have shared with you. But yoga is an extremelyeffective way to unlock your reserves of vitality. I do my yogaevery morning and it is one of the best things that I do for myself.It not only rejuvenates my body, it completely focuses my mind. Ithas even unblocked my creativity. It is a terrific discipline.\"     \"Did the sages do anything else to care for their bodies?\"     \"Yogi Raman and his brothers and sisters also believed thatvigorous walking in natural surroundings, whether high on themountain paths or deep in the lush forests, worked wonders forrelieving fatigue and restoring the body to its natural state ofvibrancy. When the weather was too harsh to walk, they wouldexercise within the security of their huts. They might miss a mealbut they would never miss their daily round of exercise.\"    \"What did they have in their huts? NordicTrack machines?\" Iquipped.    \"Not quite. Sometimes they would practice yoga postures.Other times I would catch a glimpse of them doing a set or two ofone-handed push-ups. I really think it didn't matter too much tothem what they did, so long as they moved their bodies and got thefresh air of their breath-taking surroundings flowing throughtheir lungs.\"     \"What does breathing fresh air have to do with anything?\"     \"I'll answer your question with one of Yogi Raman's favoritesayings, 'To breathe properly is to live properly.'\"     \"Breathing is that important?\" I asked in surprise.     \"Quite early on in Sivana, the sages taught me that the fastestway to double or even triple the amount of energy I had was tolearn the art of effective breathing.\"     \"But don't we all know how to breathe, even a newborn baby?\"     \"Not really, John. While most of us know how to breathe tosurvive, we have never learned how to breathe to thrive. Most ofus breathe far too shallowly and in so doing, we fail to take inenough oxygen to run the body at an optimal level.\"     \"Sounds like proper breathing involves a lot of science.\"     \"It does. And the sages treated it that way. Their philosophywas simple: take in more oxygen through efficient breathing andyou liberate your energy reserves along with your natural state ofvitality.\"     \"Okay so where do I start?\"     \"It's actually pretty easy. Two or three times a day take a minuteor two to think about breathing more deeply and effectively.\"     \"How do I know if I'm breathing effectively?\"     \"Well, your belly should move out slightly. This indicates thatyou are breathing from the abdomen, which is good. A trick thatYogi Raman taught me was to cup my hands over my stomach. Ifthey moved out as I inhaled, my breathing technique was proper.\"     \"Very interesting.\"     \"If you like that, then you will love the Third Ritual of RadiantLiving,\" said Julian.     \"Which is?\"     \"The Ritual of Live Nourishment. In my days as a litigator, Ilived off of a steady diet of steaks, fries and other types of junkfood. Sure I ate at the finest restaurants in the country, but I stillfilled my body with junk. I didn't know it at the time, but this wasone of the main sources of my discontent.\"     \"Really?\"     \"Yes. A poor diet has a pronounced effect on your life. It drainsyour mental and physical energy. It affects your moods and ithampers the clarity of your mind. Yogi Raman put it this way: 'Asyou nourish your body, so you nourish your mind.'\"     \"I assume then that you changed your diet?\"     \"Radically. And it made an amazing difference in the way I feltand looked. I always thought that I was so run down because ofthe stresses and strains of my work and because the wrinkledfingers of old age were reaching out for me. In Sivana, I learnedthat much of my lethargy was due to the low-octane fuel I waspumping into my body.\"    \"What did the Sages of Sivana eat to stay so youthful andbright?\"    \"Live foods,\" came the efficient reply.    \"Huh?\"    \"Live foods are the answer. Live foods are foods that are notdead.\"    \"C'mon, Julian. What are live foods?\" I asked impatiently.    \"Basically, live foods are those which are created through thenatural interaction of the sun, air, soil and water. What I'm talkingabout here is a vegetarian diet. Fill your plate with freshvegetables, fruits and grains and you might just live forever.\"    \"Is that possible?\"    \"Most of the sages were well over one hundred and theyshowed no signs of slowing down, and just last week I read in thepaper about a group of people living on the tiny island of Okinawain the East China Sea. Researchers are flocking to the islandbecause they are fascinated by the fact that it holds the largestconcentration of centenarians in the world.\"     \"What have they learned?\"     \"That a vegetarian diet is one of their main longevity secrets.\"     \"But is this type of diet healthy? You wouldn't think that itwould give you much strength. Remember, I'm still a busylitigator, Julian.\"     \"This is the diet that nature intended. It is alive, vital andsupremely healthy. The sages have lived by this diet for manythousands of years. They call it a sattvic, or pure diet. And as toyour concern about strength, the most powerful animals on theplanet, ranging from gorillas to elephants, wear the badge ofproud vegetarians. Did you know that a gorilla has about thirtytimes the strength of a man?\"    \"Thanks for that important tidbit of information.\"    \"Look, the sages are not extreme people. All of their wisdomwas based on the ageless principle that 'one must live a life ofmoderation and do nothing to extremes.' So if you like meat, youcan certainly keep eating it. Just remember that you are ingestingdead food. If you can, cut back on the amount of red meat that youeat. It is really hard to digest and since your digestive system isone of the most energy-consuming processes of your entire body,valuable energy reserves are needlessly depleted by this foodstuff.Do you see what I'm getting at? Just compare how you feel aftereating a steak with your energy levels after eating a salad. If youdon't want to become a strict vegetarian, at least start having asalad with every meal and fruit for dessert. Even this will make ahuge difference in the quality of your physical life.\"     \"That doesn't seem like it would be too hard to do,\" I replied.\"I've been hearing a lot about the power of a largely vegetariandiet. Just last week, Jenny told me about a study in Finland whereit was found that thirty-eight percent of new vegetarians studiedreported that they felt far less tired and much more alert afteronly seven months of this new way of life. I should try eating asalad with every meal. Looking at you, Julian, I might even makethe salad the meal.\"     \"Try it for about a month and judge the results for yourselfYou will feel phenomenal.\"     \"Okay. If it's good enough for the sages, it's good enough forme. I promise you I will give it a shot. It doesn't sound like toomuch of a stretch, and anyway I'm getting pretty tired of firing upthe barbeque every night.\"     \"If I have sold you on the Ritual of Live Nourishment, I thinkyou will love the fourth one.\"     \"Your student is still holding his empty cup.\"     \"The fourth ritual is known as the Ritual of AbundantKnowledge. It centers around the whole notion of lifelong learningand expanding your knowledge base for the good of yourself andall those around you.\"     \"The old 'knowledge is power' idea?\"     \"It involves far more than that, John. Knowledge is onlypotential power. For the power to be manifested, it must beapplied. Most people know what they should do in any givensituation, or in their lives for that matter. The problem is that theydon't take daily, consistent action to apply the knowledge andrealize their dreams. The Ritual of Abundant Knowledge is allabout becoming a student of life. Even more importantly, itrequires that you use what you have learned in the classroom ofyour existence.\"    \"What did Yogi Raman and the other sages do to live thisritual?\"    \"They had many sub-rituals which they performed on a dailybasis as a tribute to the Ritual of Abundant Knowledge. One of themost important strategies is also one of the easiest. You can evenstart doing it today.\"     \"It won't take up too much time, will it?\"    Julian smiled. \"These techniques, tools and tips I am sharingwith you will make you more productive and effective than youhave ever been. Don't be penny wise, pound foolish.\"     \"Say what?\"     \"Consider those who say that they do not have the time to backup their computers because they are too busy working on them.Yet, when those machines crash and months of important work islost, they regret not investing a few moments a day in saving it. Doyou see my point?\"     \"Get my priorities straight?\"     \"Exactly. Try not to live your life bound by the shackles of yourschedule. Instead, focus on those things that your conscience andyour heart tell you to do. When you invest in yourself and start todevote yourself to raising your mind, body and character to theirhighest levels, you will almost feel as if you have a personalnavigator inside you, telling you which things you must do to seethe greatest and most rewarding results. You will stop worryingabout your clock and start living your life.\"   \"Point well taken. So what was that simple sub-ritual you wereabout to teach me?\" I asked.     \"Read regularly. Reading for thirty minutes a day will dowonders for you. But I must caution you. Do not read justanything. You must be very selective about what you put into thelush garden of your mind. It must be immensely nourishing.Make it something that will improve both you and the quality ofyour life.\"     \"What did the sages read?\"     \"They spent many of their waking moments reading and re-reading the ancient teachings of their ancestors. They devouredthis philosophical literature. I still remember seeing thesewonderful looking people seated on little bamboo chairs readingtheir strangely bound books with the subtle smiles ofenlightenment unfolding across their lips. It was in Sivana that Ireally learned the power of the book and the principle that a bookis the best friend of the wise.\"     \"So I should start reading every good book I can get myhands on?\"     \"Yes and no,\" came the reply. \"I would never tell you not toread as many books as you can. But remember, some books aremeant to be tasted, some books are meant to be chewed and,finally, some books are meant to be swallowed whole. Whichbrings me to another point.\"     \"You're feeling hungry?\"     \"No, John,\" Julian laughed. \"I simply want to tell you that totruly get the best out of a great book, you must study it, not justread it. Go through it as you do when you read those contracts yourbig clients bring to you for your legal opinion. Really consider it,work with it, become one with it. The sages would read many of thebooks of wisdom in their vast library ten or fifteen times. Theytreated great books as scriptures, holy documents of divine origin.\"     \"Wow. Reading is really that important?\"     \"Thirty minutes a day will make a delightful difference in yourlife because you will quickly start to see the vast reserves ofknowledge available for your use. Every answer to every problemyou have ever faced is in print. If you want to be a better lawyer,father, friend or lover, there are books out there that will rocket youto those goals. All the mistakes you will ever make in your life havealready been made by those that have walked before you. Do youreally think that the challenges you are facing are unique to you?\"     \"I've never thought about it, Julian. But I see what you aresaying, and I know you are right.\"     \"All the problems anyone has ever, and will ever face over thecourse of their lifetime have already been made,\" Julian asserted.\"More importantly, the answers and solutions are all recorded onthe pages of books. Read the right books. Learn how those whohave preceded you have handled the challenges you are currentlyfacing. Apply their strategies for success and you will beastonished by the improvements you will note in your life.\"     \"What exactly are 'the right books?'\" I asked, quickly realizingthat Julian's point was an excellent one.     \"I'll leave that to your good judgment my friend. Personally,since I have returned from the East, I spend the better part of mydays reading biographies of the men and women I have come toadmire and a great deal of the wisdom of literature.\"     \"Any titles you could recommend to an eager young beaver?\"I said, flashing a broad grin.     \"Sure. You will thrive on the biography of the great American,Benjamin Franklin. I think you will also find much growth impetusfrom Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography entitled The Story of MyExperiments with Truth. I also suggest that you read Siddharthaby Hermann Hesse, the highly practical philosophy of MarcusAurelius and some of the work of Seneca. You might even readThink and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. I read it last week andthought it was very profound.\"     \"Think and Grow Rich!\" I exclaimed. \"But I thought you leftall of that behind you after your heart attack. I'm really sick andtired of all the 'make-money-fast manuals' that are being peddledout there by snake-oil salesmen preying on the weak.\"     \"Easy, big fella! I couldn't agree with you more,\" offeredJulian with all the warmth and patience of a wise, lovinggrandfather. \"I too want to restore the character ethic to oursociety. That little book is not about making a lot of money, it isabout making a lot of life. I will be the first to tell you that there isa huge difference between well-being and being well off. I've livedit and know the pain of a money-driven life. Think and Grow Richis about abundance, including spiritual abundance, and how toattract all that is good into your life. You might do well to read it.But I will not press the point.\"     \"Sorry Julian, I didn't mean to sound like an aggressivelitigator,\" I offered apologetically. \"I guess my temper gets thebetter of me sometimes. One more thing I need to improve. Ireally am grateful for all that you are sharing with me.\"     \"No problem, water under the bridge. My point simply is readand keep reading. Do you want to know something elseinteresting?\"     \"What?\"     \"It's not what you will get out of the books that is so enriching— it is what the books will get out of you that will ultimatelychange your life. You see, John, books do not actually teach youanything new.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Really. Books simply help you to see what is already withinyour self. That's what enlightenment is all about. After all myjourneying and exploring I found that I have actually come fullcircle back to the point from which I started as a young boy. Butnow I know myself and all that I am and can be.    \"So the Ritual of Abundant Knowledge is all about reading andexploring the wealth of information out there?\"    \"Partly. For now, read thirty minutes a day. The rest will comenaturally,\" Julian said with a hint of mystery.     \"Okay, what's the Fifth Ritual of Radiant Living?\"     \"It is the Ritual of Personal Reflection. The sages were firmbelievers in the power of inner contemplation. By taking the timeto get to know yourself, you will connect to a dimension of yourbeing that you never knew you had.\"     \"Sounds pretty deep.\"     \"It's actually a very practical concept. You see, we all havemany sleeping talents inside of us. By taking the time to get toknow them, we kindle them. However, silent contemplation willdeliver even more than this. This practice will make you stronger,more at ease with yourself and wiser. It is a very rewarding use ofyour mind.\"    \"I'm still a little fuzzy on the concept, Julian.\"    \"Fair enough. It was also foreign to me when I first heard it.Boiled down to its basic form, personal reflection is nothing morethan the habit of thinking.\"    \"But don't we all think? Isn't that part of being human?\"    \"Well, most of us do think. The problem is that most peoplethink just enough to survive. What I am speaking about with thisritual is thinking enough to thrive. When you read Ben Franklin'sbiography you will see what I mean. Every evening, after a full dayof productive work, he would retire to a silent corner of his homeand reflect on his day. He would consider all of his actions andwhether they were positive and constructive or whether they wereof the negative sort, in need of repair. By clearly knowing what hewas doing wrong in his days, he could take immediate steps toimprove and advance along the path of self-mastery. The sages didthe same. Every night, they would retire to the sanctuary of theirhuts covered by fragrant rose petals and sit in deep contemplation.Yogi Raman would actually take a written inventory of his day.\"     \"What kinds of things would he write down?\" I asked.     \"First he would list all of his activities, from the personal careactivities of his morning to his interactions with the other sages tohis forays into the forest in search of firewood and fresh food.Interestingly, he would also write down the thoughts he had runthrough his mind during that particular day.\"     \"Isn't that hard to do? I can hardly remember what I thoughtfive minutes ago let alone twelve hours ago.\"     \"Not if you practice this ritual daily. You see, anyone can attainthe kind of results I have attained. Anyone. The real problem isthat too many people suffer from that dreadful disease known asexcusitus.\"     \"I think I might have contracted that one in the past,\" I said infull knowledge of what my wise friend was saying.     \"Stop making excuses and just do it!\" Julian exclaimed, hisvoice resonating with the strength of conviction.     \"Do what?\"     \"Take the time to think. Get into the regular habit of personalintrospection. Once Yogi Raman had listed all that he had done andall that he had thought in one column, he would then do anassessment in another column. As he was confronted by hisactivities and thoughts in the written form, he asked himselfwhether they were positive in nature. If they were, he resolved tocontinue giving his precious energy to them, as they would payhuge dividends in the long run.\"    \"And if they were negative?\"    \"Then he would come up with a clear course of action to get ridof them.\"    \"I think an example might help me.\"     \"Can it be personal?\" Julian asked.     \"Sure, I'd love to know some of your innermost thoughts,\" Isuggested.     \"Actually, I was thinking about yours.\"    We both started to giggle like a couple of kids in a schoolyard.     \"Oh, alright. You always did get your way.\"     \"Okay let's go through just a few of the things that you didtoday. Write them down on that piece of paper on the coffee table,\"Julian instructed.     I started to realize that something important was about tohappen. This was the first time in years that I had actually takenthe time to do nothing but reflect on the things I was doing and thethoughts that I was thinking. It was all so strange and yet sointelligent. After all, how could I ever hope to improve myself andmy life if I hadn't even taken the time to figure out what I wassupposed to improve?\"    \"Where do I start?\" I asked.    \"Start with what you did this morning and progress throughyour day. Just hit a few of the highlights, we still have a fair amountof ground to cover and I want to get back to Yogi Raman's fable ina few minutes.\"     \"Fine. I woke up at six-thirty to the sound of my electricrooster,\" I joked.     \"Get serious and keep going,\" Julian replied firmly.     \"Okay. Then I showered and shaved, gobbled down a waffleand rushed off to work.\"     \"And what about your family?\"     \"They were all asleep. Anyway, once I got to the office, Inoticed that my seven-thirty appointment had been waiting theresince seven, and boy, was he furious!\"     \"What was your response?\"     \"I fought back, what was I supposed to do, let him push mearound?\"     \"Hmm. Okay. Then what happened?\"     \"Well, things went from bad to worse. The courthouse calledand told me that Judge Wildabest needed to see me in hischambers and if I wasn't there within ten minutes, 'heads wouldroll.' You remember Wildabest don't you? You were the one whonicknamed him Judge Wild Beast after he held you in contemptfor parking your Ferrari in his parking spot!\" I recalled, breakinginto laughter.     \"You would have to bring that up, wouldn't you?\" Julianreplied, his eyes revealing the remnants of that mischievoustwinkle he was once well known for.     \"Anyway I rushed down to the courthouse and had anotherargument with one of the clerks. By the time I got back to theoffice, there were twenty-seven phone messages waiting for me,all marked 'urgent.' Need I go on?\"     \"Please do.\"     \"Well on the way home, Jenny called me in the car and askedme to stop by her mother's house and pick up one of those amazingpies my mother-in-law is famous for. Problem was that when I tookthat exit, I found myself in the middle of a gridlock that was worsethan anything I have seen in ages. So there I was, in the middle ofrush-hour traffic, in ninety-five-degree heat, shaking with stressand feeling that even more time was slipping away.\"    \"How did you respond?\"    \"I cursed the traffic,\" I said with complete honesty. \"I wasactually shouting out loud inside my car. Do you want to know whatI said?\"    \"I don't think that would be the kind of thing that wouldnourish the garden of my mind,\" Julian responded with a softsmile.    \"But it might make for good fertilizer.\"    \"No thanks. Maybe we should stop there. Just take a secondand look at your day. Obviously, in retrospect, there are at least afew things that you would do differently if you had the chance.\"     \"Obviously.\"     \"Like what?\"     \"Hmm. Well, first, in a perfect world I would get up earlier. Idon't think I'm doing myself any favors by hitting the groundrunning. I'd like to have a little peace in the morning and easemyself into the day. The Heart of the Rose technique you told meabout earlier sounds like it would be fun. Also, I really would like tohave the family around the breakfast table, even if only for a bowlof cereal. It would give me a better sense of balance. I always seemto feel that I never spend enough time with Jenny and the kids.\"     \"But it is a perfect world, and you have a perfect life. You dohave the power to control your day. You do have the power to thinkgood thoughts. You do have the power to live your dreams!\" Julianobserved, his voice rising.     \"I am realizing this. I really am starting to feel that I canchange.\"     \"Great. Continue reflecting on your day,\" he instructed.     \"Well, I wish I hadn't yelled at my client. I wish I hadn'targued with the court clerk and I wish I hadn't screamed at thetraffic.\"     \"The traffic doesn't care, does it?\"     \"It just keeps on being traffic,\" I noted.     \"I think you now see the power of the Ritual of PersonalReflection. By looking at what you are doing, how you arespending your day and the thoughts you are thinking, you giveyourself a benchmark for measuring improvement. The only wayto improve tomorrow is to know what you did wrong today.\"     \"And come up with a clear plan so that it doesn't happenagain?\" I added.     \"Precisely. There is nothing wrong with making mistakes.Mistakes are part of life and essential for growth. It's like thatsaying, 'Happiness comes through good judgment, good judgmentcomes through experience, and experience comes through badjudgment.' But there is something very wrong with making thesame mistakes over and over again, day in and day out. This showsa complete lack of self-awareness, the very quality that separateshumans from animals.\"     \"I've never heard that one before.\"     \"Well it's true. Only a human being can step out of himself andanalyze what he is doing right and what he is doing wrong. A dogcannot do this. A bird cannot do this. Even a monkey cannot do it.But you can. This is what the Ritual of Personal Reflection is allabout. Figure out what is right and what is wrong in your days andin your life. Then set about making immediate improvements.\"     \"Lots to think about, Julian. Lots to think about,\" I offeredreflectively.     \"How about thinking about the Sixth Ritual for RadiantLiving: the Ritual of Early Awakening.\"     \"Uh-oh. I think I know what's coming.\"     \"One of the best pieces of advice I learned in that far-off oasisof Sivana was to rise with the sun and to start the day off well.Most of us sleep far more than we need to. The average person canget by on six hours — and remain perfectly healthy and alert.Sleep is really nothing more than a habit and like any other habit,you can train yourself to achieve the result you want; sleeping lessin this case.\"     \"But if I get up too early, I really do feel exhausted,\" I said.     \"For the first few days, you will feel very tired. I'll freely admitthis. You might even feel this way for the first week of getting upnice and early. Please see this as a small measure of short-termpain for a large measure of long-term gain. You will always feel alittle discomfort when you are installing a new habit. It's sort oflike breaking in a new pair of shoes — at first it's a little hard towear them but soon they fit like a glove. As I told you earlier, painis often the precursor to personal growth. Don't dread it Instead,embrace it.\"    \"Okay, I like the idea of training myself to get up earlier. First,let me ask you what does 'early' mean?\"    \"Another fine question. There is no ideal time. Just likeeverything else I have shared with you so far, do what is right foryou. Remember Yogi Raman's admonishment: 'nothing toextremes, everything in moderation.'\"    \"Getting up with the sun sounds extreme.\"    \"Actually it isn't. There are few things more natural than risingwith the glory of the first rays of a new day. The sages believedthat sunshine was a gift from Heaven and while they were carefulnot to overexpose themselves, they regularly had sunbaths andoften could be seen dancing playfully in the early morningsunshine. I firmly believe that this was another key to theirextraordinary longevity.\"    \"Do you sunbathe?\" I asked.    \"Absolutely. The sun rejuvenates me. When I grow tired itkeeps my mood bright. In the ancient culture of the East, the sunwas thought to be a connection to the soul. People worshipped itas it allowed their crops to flourish along with their spirits.Sunlight will release your vitality and restore your emotional andphysical vibrancy. It is a delightful physician, when visited inmoderation of course. Alas, I digress. The point is to get up early,every day.\"    \"Hmm. How do I build this ritual into my routine?\"    \"Here are a couple of quick tips. First, never forget that it isthe quality and not the quantity of sleep that is important. It isbetter to have six hours of uninterrupted deep sleep than even tenhours of disturbed sleep. The whole idea is to provide your bodywith rest so that its natural processes can repair and restore yourphysical dimension to its natural state of health, a state that isdiminished through the stresses and struggles of daily use. Manyof the habits of the sages are based on the principle that one muststrive for quality rest rather than quantity sleep. For example,\"Yogi Raman would never eat after 8:00 p.m. He said that thedigestive activity it induced would reduce the quality of his sleep.Another example was the sages' habit of meditating to the softsounds of their harp immediately before heading off to sleep.\"    \"What was the reason behind this?\"     \"Let me ask you, John. What do you do before you go to sleepevery night?\"     \"I watch the news with Jenny, the same as most people I know.\"     \"I kind of thought so,\" replied Julian, with a mysterioustwinkle in his eyes.     \"I don't get it. What could possibly be wrong with getting alittle shot of the news before I go to sleep?\"     \"The ten-minute period before you sleep and the ten-minuteperiod after you wake up are profoundly influential on yoursubconscious mind. Only the most inspiring and serene thoughtsshould be programmed into your mind at those times.\"     \"You make the mind sound like a computer.\"     \"That's a pretty fair way to look at it — what you put in is whatyou get out. Even more important is the fact that you alone are theprogrammer. By determining the thoughts that go in, you also aredetermining precisely what will come out. So, before you go tosleep, don't watch the news or argue with anyone or even go overthe day's events in your mind's eye. Relax. Drink a cup of herbaltea, if you like. Listen to some soft classical music and prepareyourself to drift off into a rich, renewing slumber.\"     \"It makes sense. The better the sleep, the less I will need.\"     \"Exactly. And remember the Ancient Rule of Twenty-one: ifyou do anything for twenty-one days in a row, it will be installed asa habit. So stay with the early-rising routine for about three weeksbefore you give up because it feels too uncomfortable. By then itwill be a part of your life. Within short order you will be able to riseat 5:30 a.m. or even at 5:00 a.m. with ease, ready to savor thesplendor of another great day.\"  \"Okay, so let's say that I am getting up every day at five-thirty.What do I do?\"    \"Your questions show that you are thinking, my friend. Iappreciate this. Once you are up, there are many things you cando. The fundamental principle to keep in mind is the importance ofstarting your day off well. As I've suggested, the thoughts youthink and the actions you take in the first ten minutes after youwake up have a very marked effect on the rest of your day.\"     \"Seriously?\"     \"Absolutely. Think positive thoughts. Give a prayer of thanksfor all you have. Work on your gratitude list. Listen to some greatmusic. Watch the sun come up, or perhaps go for a quick walk innatural surroundings if you feel up to it. The sages would actuallymake themselves laugh whether they felt like it or not, just to getthe 'happiness juices' flowing early in the morning.\"     \"Julian, I am trying very hard to keep my cup empty — and Ithink you will agree that I've done pretty well for a novice. Butthat really sounds odd, even for a band of monks living high in theHimalayas.\"     \"But it is not. Take a guess how many times the average four-year-old laughs in a day.\"     \"Who knows?\"     \"I do, three hundred. Now guess how many times the averageadult in our society laughs in the course of a day.\"     \"Fifty?\" I tried.     \"Try fifteen,\" Julian said, smiling in satisfaction. \"You see mypoint? Laughing is medicine for the soul. Even if you don't feel likeit, look in the mirror and laugh for a couple of minutes. You can'thelp but feel fantastic. William James said, 'We don't laughbecause we are happy. We are happy because we laugh.' So startyour day on a delightful footing. Laugh, play and give thanks forall you have. Every day will be an exquisitely rewarding one.\"    \"What do you do to start your day off on a positive footing?\"    \"Actually, I have developed quite a sophisticated morningroutine which includes everything from the Heart of the Rose todrinking a couple of glasses of freshly squeezed fruit juice. Butthere is one strategy in particular which I would like to share withyou.\"    \"Sounds important.\"    \"It is. Shortly after you have awakened, go into your sanctuaryof silence. Get still and focused. Then ask yourself this question:'What would I do today if today was my last?' The key is to reallyget into the meaning of this question. Mentally list all the thingsyou would do, the people you would call and the moments youwould savor. Envision yourself doing these things with greatenergy. Visualize how you would treat your family and yourfriends. Even picture how you would treat total strangers if todaywas your last day on the planet. As I told you earlier, when you liveevery day as if it was your last, your life will take on a magicalquality.     \"And this brings me to the seventh of the Rituals of RadiantLiving: the Ritual of Music.\"     \"I think I'm going to love this one,\" I replied.     \"I'm sure you will. The sages loved their music. It gave themthe same spiritual boost as the sun did. Music made them laugh, itmade them dance and it made them sing. It will do the same foryou. Never forget the power of music. Spend a little time with itevery day, even if it is listening to a soft piece on a cassette whileyou drive to work. When you feel down or weary, play some music.It is one of the finest motivators I know of.\"    \"Aside from yourself!\" I exclaimed sincerely. \"Just listening toyou makes me feel great. You really have changed, Julian, and notjust on the outside. Gone is your old cynicism. Gone is your formernegativity. Gone is your old aggressiveness. You really do seem tobe at peace with yourself. You have touched me tonight.\"     \"Hey, there's more!\" shouted Julian with his fist in the air.\"Let's keep going.\"     \"I wouldn't have it any other way.\"     \"Okay. The eighth ritual is the Ritual of the Spoken Word. Thesages had a series of mantras which they would recite morning,noon and night. They told me that this practice was immenselyeffective in keeping them focused, strong and happy.\"     \"What's a mantra?\" I asked.     \"A mantra is nothing more than a collection of words strungtogether to create a positive effect. In Sanskrit, 'man' means'mind' and 'tra' means 'freeing.' So a mantra is a phrase which isdesigned to free the mind. And, believe me, John, mantrasaccomplish this objective in a very powerful way.\"     \"Are you using mantras in your daily routine?\"     \"I sure am. They are my faithful companions wherever I go.Whether I am on the bus, walking to the library or watching theworld go by in a park, I am constantly affirming all that is good inmy world through mantras.\"     \"So mantras are spoken?\"     \"They do not have to be. Written affirmations are also veryeffective. But I have found that repeating a mantra aloud has awonderful effect on my spirit. When I need to feel motivated, Imight repeat, 'I am inspired, disciplined and energized' out loudtwo or three hundred times. To maintain the supreme sense ofself-confidence I have cultivated, I repeat, 'I am strong, able andcalm.' I even use mantras to keep me youthful and vital,\" Julianadmitted.     \"How could a mantra keep you young?\"     \"Words affect the mind in a pronounced way. Whether they arespoken or written, they are powerful influences. While what yousay to others is important, even more important is what you say toyourself.\"     \"Self-talk?\"     \"Exactly. You are what you think about all day long. You arealso what you say to yourself all day long. If you say that you areold and tired, this mantra will be manifested in your externalreality. If you say you are weak and lack enthusiasm, this too willbe the nature of your world. But if you say that you are healthy,dynamic and fully alive, your life will be transformed. You see, thewords you say to yourself affect your self-image and your self-image determines what actions you take. For example, if your self-image is one of a person who lacks the confidence to do anythingof value, you will only be able to take actions which are alignedwith this trait. On the other hand, if your self-image is one of aradiant individual who is fearless, again, all your actions willcorrespond to this quality. Your self-image is a self-fulfillingprophecy of sorts.\"     \"How so?\"     \"If you believe that you are unable to do something, let's say,find that perfect partner or live a stress-free life, your beliefs willaffect your self-image. In turn, your self-image will prevent youfrom taking steps to find the perfect partner or to create a serenelife for yourself. It will actually sabotage any efforts you mightmake in this direction.\"     \"Why does it work this way?\"     \"Simple. Your self-image is a governor of sorts. It will never letyou act in a way that is inconsistent with it. The beautiful thing isthat you can change your self-image, just like you can changeeverything else in your life if it is not serving to enhance it.Mantras are a great way accomplish this objective.\"     \"And when I change my inner world, I change my outerworld,\" I said dutifully.     \"My, how quickly you learn,\" Julian said, giving me thethumbs-up sign he had used so much in his former life as a starlitigator.     \"Which leads us into the Ninth Ritual of Radiant Living quitenicely. This is the Ritual of a Congruent Character. It is sort of anoff-shoot of the self-image concept we were just talking about.Simply stated, this ritual requires you to take daily, incrementalaction to build your character. Strengthening your characteraffects the way you see yourself and the actions you take. Theactions you take come together to form your habits and, this isimportant, your habits lead you to your destiny. Perhaps YogiRaman articulated the formula best when he stated: 'You sow athought, you reap an action. Reap an action, you sow a habit. Sowa habit, you reap a character. Sow a character, you reap yourdestiny.'\"     \"What kinds of things should I do to build my character?\"     \"Anything that cultivates your virtues. Before you ask mewhat I mean by 'virtues,' let me clarify the concept. The wisepeople of the Himalayas believed strongly that a virtuous life wasa meaningful life. So they governed all of their actions by a seriesof timeless principles.\"     \"But I thought you said they governed their lives by theirpurpose?\"     \"Yes, this is quite so, but their life's calling included living in amanner congruent to these principles, ones that their ancestorsheld dear to their hearts for thousands of years.\"     \"What are these principles, Julian?\" I asked.     \"They are, simply stated: industry, compassion, humility,patience, honesty and courage. When all your actions arecongruent and aligned with these principles, you will feel a deepsense of inner harmony and peace. Living this way will inevitablylead you to spiritual success. This is because you will be doing whatis right. You will be acting in a way that is in accordance with thelaws of nature and the laws of the universe. This is when you willstart to tap into the energy of another dimension, call it a higherpower if you will. This is also when your life will move from theordinary into the realm of the extraordinary and you begin tosense the sacredness of your being. It is the first step to lifelongenlightenment.\"     \"Have you tasted this experience?\" I asked.     \"I have, and I believe you will too. Do the right things. Act in away that is congruent with your true character. Act with integrity.Be guided by your heart. The rest will take care of itself. You arenever alone, you know,\" replied Julian.     \"What do you mean?\"     \"I'll explain it to you another time perhaps. For now,remember that you must do little things every day to build yourcharacter. As Emerson said: 'Character is higher than intellect. Agreat soul will be strong to live as well as to think.' Your characteris built when you act in a way that corresponds with the principlesI've just mentioned. If you fail to do this, true happiness willalways elude you.\"     \"And the final ritual?\"     \"This is the all-important Ritual of Simplicity. This ritualrequires you to live a simple life. As Yogi Raman said 'one mustnever live in the thick of thin things. Focus only on your priorities,those activities which are truly meaningful. Your life will beuncluttered, rewarding and exceptionally peaceful. This Ipromise you.'     \"He was right. The moment I started to separate the wheatfrom the chaff, harmony filled my life. I stopped living at thefrenetic pace to which I had grown accustomed. I stopped livingmy life in the eye of the tornado. Instead, I slowed down and tookthe time to smell the proverbial roses.\"     \"What things did you do to cultivate simplicity?\"     \"I stopped wearing expensive clothes, I kicked my addiction tosix newspapers a day, I stopped needing to be available to everyoneall the time, I became a vegetarian and I ate less. Basically, Ireduced my needs. You see, John, unless you reduce your needs,you will never be fulfilled. You will always be like that gambler inLas Vegas, staying at the roulette wheel for 'just one more spin' inthe hope that your lucky number will come up. You will always wantmore than you have. How can you ever be happy?\"    \"But earlier you told me that happiness comes fromachievement. Now you are telling me to reduce my needs and becontent with less. Isn't this a paradox?\"     \"Excellent point, John. Brilliant in fact. It might seem like acontradiction, but it isn't. Lifelong happiness does come throughstriving to realize your dreams. You are at your best when you aremoving forward. The key is not to make your happinesscontingent on finding that elusive pot of gold at the end of therainbow. For example, even though I was a millionaire many timesover, I told myself that success to me meant having three hundredmillion dollars in my bank account. This was a recipe for disaster.\"    \"Three hundred million?\" I asked in disbelief.     \"Three hundred million. So no matter how much I had, I wasnever satisfied. I was always unhappy. It was nothing more thangreed. I can now admit this freely. It was much like the story ofKing Midas. I'm sure you have heard that one?\"     \"Sure. The man who loved gold so much he prayed thateverything he touched would turn to gold. When his wish wasgranted he rejoiced. That was until he realized that he couldn't eatbecause his food had turned to gold and so on, so forth.\"     \"Right. Similarly, I was so money-driven that I couldn't enjoyall that I had. You know there came a time when all that I could eatwas bread and water,\" Julian said, growing very quiet and pensive.     \"Are you serious? I always thought you ate at the bestrestaurants with all those celebrity friends of yours.\"     \"That was in the early days. Not many people know about this,but the burden of my out-of-control lifestyle gave me a bleedingulcer. I couldn't even eat a hot dog without getting sick. What a life!All that money and all I could eat was bread and water. It waspathetic really.\" Julian caught himself \"But I'm not one to live inthe past. It was another one of life's great lessons. As I told youearlier, pain is a powerful teacher. To transcend pain, I had to firstexperience it. I wouldn't be where I am today without it,\" he saidstoically.    \"Any ideas on what I should do to bring the Ritual of Simplicityinto my own life?\" I asked.    \"There are so many things you can do. Even little things willmake a difference.\"    \"Like what?\"    \"Stop picking up the phone every time it rings, stop wastingtime reading junk mail, stop eating out three times a week, give upyour golf-club membership and spend more time with your kids,spend a day a week without your watch, watch the sun rise everyfew days, sell your cellular phone and dump the pager. Need Icontinue?\" Julian asked rhetorically.     \"I get the point. But sell the cell phone?\" I asked anxiously,feeling as a baby might at the doctor's suggestion that hisumbilical cord should be cut.     \"Like I've said, my duty is to share the wisdom I have learnedthrough my journey with you. You need not apply every strategyto make your life work. Try the techniques and use those that feelright to you.\"     \"I know. Nothing to extremes, everything in moderation.\"     \"Precisely.\"     \"I have to admit though, every one of your strategies soundsgreat. But will they really bring about profound shifts in my life inonly thirty days?\"     \"It will take even less than thirty days — and even more,\" saidJulian, with his trademark look of dimpled mischievousness.     \"Here we go again. Do explain, O Wise One.\"     \"'Julian' will be fine, although 'Wise One' would have lookedformidable on my old letterhead,\" he joked. \"I say it will take lessthan thirty days because true life change is spontaneous.\"     \"Spontaneous?\"     \"Yes, it happens in the blink of an eye, the very moment youdecide from the deepest core of your being that you will raise yourlife to its highest level. In that instant, you will be a changedperson, one set on the course of his destiny.\"     \"And why longer than thirty days?\"     \"I promise you that by practicing these strategies and tools,you will see marked improvements in one month from thismoment. You will have more energy, less worries, more creativityand less stress in every aspect of your life. Having said this, thesages' methods are not of the quick-fix kind. They are agelesstraditions which are meant to be applied daily, for the rest of yourdays. If you stop applying them, you will find that you willgradually slide back into your old ways.\"     After Julian had explained the Ten Rituals for Radiant Livingto me, he paused. \"I know that you want me to keep going so I will.I believe so strongly in what I am sharing with you that I don'tmind keeping you up all night. Perhaps this is a good time to get alittle deeper.\"     \"What exactly do you mean? I think all that I have heardtonight is pretty deep,\" I said in surprise.     \"The secrets I have explained will allow you and all those youcome into contact with to create the lives you desire. But there ismuch more to the philosophy of the Sages of Sivana than meets theeye. What I have taught you up to now has been immenselypractical. But you must know something of the underlyingspiritual current which flows through the principles I haveoutlined. If you do not understand what I am speaking about, don'tworry at this point. Simply take it in and chew on it for a while, youcan digest it later.\"    \"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear?\"    \"Precisely,\" said Julian, now smiling. \"You always were aquick study.\"    \"Okay, let's hear the spiritual stuff,\" I said energetically,unaware that it was nearly two-thirty in the morning.    \"Within you lies the sun, the moon, the sky and all the wondersof this universe. The intelligence that created these wonders is thesame force that created you. All things around you come from thesame source. We are all one.\"     \"I'm not sure I follow you.\"     \"Every being on this Earth, every object on this Earth has asoul. All souls flow into one, this is the Soul of the Universe. Yousee, John, when you nourish your own mind and your own spirit,you are really feeding the Soul of the Universe. When you improveyourself, you are improving the lives of all those around you. Andwhen you have the courage to advance confidently in the directionof your dreams, you begin to draw upon the power of the universe.As I told you earlier, life gives you what you ask of it. It is alwayslistening.\"     \"So self-mastery and kaizen will help me help others byhelping me help myself?\"     \"Something like that. As you enrich your mind, as you care foryour body and as you nurture your spirit, you will come tounderstand exactly what I am saying.\"     \"Julian. I know you mean well. But self-mastery is a prettyhigh ideal for a 215-pound family man who, up to now, has spentmore time on client development than personal development.What happens if I fail?\"     \"Failure is not having the courage to try, nothing more andnothing less. The only thing standing between most people andtheir dreams is the fear of failure. Yet failure is essential to successin any endeavor. Failure tests us and allows us to grow. It offers uslessons and guides us along the path of enlightenment. The teachersof the East say that every arrow that hits the bull's eye is the resultof one hundred misses. It is a fundamental Law of Nature to profitthrough loss. Never fear failure. Failure is your friend.\"     \"Embrace failure?\" I asked in disbelief     \"The universe favors the brave. When you resolve, once andfor all, to lift your life to its highest level, the strength of your soulwill guide you. Yogi Raman believed that everyone's destiny waslaid out for them at birth. This path always leads to a magical placefilled with magnificent treasures. It was up to each individual todevelop the courage to walk this way. There is a story he sharedwith me that I would like to pass on to you. Once, in ancient India,there was an evil giant who owned a magnificent castleoverlooking the sea. As the giant had been away for many yearsfighting in wars, the children of the nearby village used to comeinto the giant's beautiful garden and play with great delight. Oneday, the giant returned and threw all of the young children out ofhis garden. 'Never return here!' he yelled as he slammed the hugeoak door in disgust. He then erected a huge marble wall aroundthe garden to keep the children out.     \"Winter came with bitter cold which is native to thenorthernmost parts of the Indian subcontinent, and the giantwished the warmth would soon return. Spring visited the villagewhich lay below the giant's castle, but the icy claws of winterrefused to leave his garden. Then, one day, the giant finally smelledthe fragrances of Spring and felt the radiance of the sun throughhis windows. \"Spring has finally returned!\" he cried, running outinto the garden. But the giant was unprepared for the sight whichgreeted him. The children of the village had somehow managed toclimb over the castle wall and were playing in the garden. It wasbecause of their presence that the garden had been transformedfrom a wintry wasteland into a lush place filled with roses, daffodils and orchids. All the children laughed and giggled withjoy, but one. From the corner of his eye, the giant spotted a littleboy who was much smaller than all the other children. Tears ran from his eyes as he did not have the strength to climb the wall into the garden. The giant felt sad for this boy and, for the first time inhis life, regretted his evil ways. 'I will help this child,' he said,running towards him. When all the other children saw the giantcoming, they ran from the garden, fearing for their lives. But thetiny little boy stood his ground. 'I will slay the giant,' hestammered. 'I will defend our playground.'     \"As the giant approached the child, he opened his arms. 'I ama friend,' he said. 'I have come to help you over the wall and intothe garden. This will be your garden now.'\" The little boy, now ahero amongst the children, rejoiced in happiness and gave thegiant the golden necklace which he had always worn around hisneck. 'This is my lucky charm,' he said. 'I want you to have it.'     \"From that day on, the children played with the giant in hiswonderful garden. But the brave little boy whom the giant lovedthe most never did return. As time went on, the giant grew ill andfrail. The children continued to play in the garden but the giant nolonger had the strength to keep them company. In those quietdays, it was the little boy who the giant thought of the most.     \"One day, in the midst of a particularly bitter winter, the giantglanced out his window and saw a truly miraculous sight: thoughmost of the garden was covered in snow, at the center of thegarden there stood a magnificent rosebush overflowing withspectacularly colored flowers. Next to the roses stood the little boywho the giant loved. The boy was smiling sweetly. The giantdanced with delight and rushed outside to embrace the child.'Where have you been all these years, my young friend? I'vemissed you with all my heart.'     \"The boy was thoughtful in his response. 'Many years ago youlifted me over the wall into your magical garden. Now, I havecome to take you into mine.' Later that day, when the childrencame to visit the giant they found him lying lifeless on the ground.From head to toe, he was covered by a thousand beautiful roses.    \"Always be brave, John, like that little boy. Stand your groundand follow your dreams. They will lead you to your destiny. Followyour destiny, it will lead you into the wonders of the universe. Andalways follow the wonders of the universe, for they will lead you toa special garden filled with roses.\"    As I looked over at Julian to tell him that this story hadtouched me deeply, I saw something that startled me: this rock-hard legal gladiator who had spent the better part of his lifedefending the rich and famous had started to weep.

CHAPTER TEN         The Power of Discipline         Sure I am that this day we are masters of our fate,     that the task which has been set before us is not above     our strengths; that its pangs and toils are not beyond     my endurance. As long as we have faith in our own     cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will     not be denied us.                                           Winston ChurchillJulian continued to use Yogi Raman's mystical fable as thecornerstone for the wisdom he was sharing with me. I had learnedof the garden within my mind, a storehouse of power andpotential. Through the symbol of the lighthouse, I had learned ofthe over-riding importance of a definite purpose in life and theeffectiveness of goal-setting. By the example of the nine-foot-tall,nine-hundred-pound Japanese sumo wrestler, I had receivedinstruction on the timeless concept of kaizen and the bountifulbenefits that self-mastery would bring. Little did I know that thebest was still to come.    \"You will recall that our friend the sumo wrestler was starknaked.\"    \"Except for the pink wire cable covering his private parts,\" Iinterjected gamely.    \"Right,\" applauded Julian. \"The pink wire cable will serve toremind you of the power of self-control and discipline in building aricher, happier and more enlightened life. My teachers in Sivanawere undoubtedly the most healthy, contented and serene people Ihave ever met. They were also the most disciplined. These sagestaught me that the virtue of self-discipline was like a wire cable.Have you ever really taken the time to study a wire cable, John?\"     \"It hasn't been high on my priority list,\" I confessed with aquick grin.     \"Well, have a look at one sometime. You will see that it consistsof many thin, tiny wires placed one on top of the other. Alone, eachone is flimsy and weak. But, together, their sum is much greaterthan their constituent parts and the cable becomes tougher thaniron. Self-control and willpower are similar to this. To build a willof iron, it is essential to take small, tiny acts in tribute to the virtueof personal discipline. Routinely performed, the little acts pile oneon top of another to eventually produce an abundance of innerstrength. Perhaps the old African proverb says it best: 'Whenspider webs unite, they tie up a lion.' When you liberate yourwillpower, you become the master of your personal world. Whenyou continually practice the ancient art of self-government, therewill be no hurdle too high for you to overcome, no challenge tootough for you to surmount and no crisis too hot for you to cooldown. Self-discipline will provide you with the mental reservesrequired to persevere when life throws you one of its little curves.\"    \"I must also alert you to the fact that the lack of willpower is amental disease,\" Julian added surprisingly. \"If you suffer from thisweakness, make it a priority to stamp it out quickly. An abundanceof willpower and discipline is one of the chief attributes of all thosewith strong characters and wonderful lives. Willpower allows youto do what you said you would do, when you said you would do it.It is willpower that allows you to get up at five in the morning tocultivate your mind through meditation, or to feed your spirit by awalk in the woods when a cozy bed beckons you on a cold winter'sday. It is willpower that allows you to hold your tongue when a less-actualized person insults you or does something you disagree with.It is willpower that pushes your dreams forward when the oddsappear to be insurmountable. It is willpower that offers you theinner power to keep your commitments to others, and, perhapseven more importantly, to yourself.\"     \"Is it really that important?\"     \"Most certainly, my friend. It is the essential virtue of everyperson who has created a life rich with passion, possibility andpeace.\"     Julian then reached into his robe and pulled out a shiny silverlocket, the kind you might see in a museum exhibit on ancientEgypt.     \"You shouldn't have,\" I joked.     \"The Sages of Sivana gave this gift to me on my last eveningwith them. It was a joyous, loving celebration between members ofa family who lived life to the fullest. It was one of the greatest, andsaddest nights of my life. I didn't want to leave the Nirvana ofSivana. It was my sanctuary, an oasis of all that was good in thisworld. The sages had become my spiritual brothers and sisters. Ileft part of myself high in the Himalayas that evening.\" Julian said,his voice growing soft.    \"What are the words engraved on the locket?\"    \"Here, I'll read them to you. Never forget them, John. Theyhave really helped me when times got tough. I pray that they alsobathe you in comfort during times of difficulty. They say:    Through the steel of discipline, you will forge a character   rich with courage and peace. Through the virtue of Will,   you are destined to rise to life's highest ideal and live   within a heavenly mansion filled with all that is good,   joyful and vital. Without them, you are lost like a   mariner without a compass, one who eventually sinks   with his ship.    \"I have never really thought about the importance of self-control, although there have been many times I've wished I hadmore discipline,\" I admitted. \"Are you saying that I can actuallybuild discipline, the way my teenage son builds his biceps at thelocal gym?\"    \"The analogy is an excellent one. You condition yourwillpower just as your son conditions his body at the gym.Anyone, no matter how weak or lethargic they might currentlybe, can grow disciplined within a relatively short time. MahatmaGandhi is a good example. When most people think of thismodern-day saint they remember a man who could go weekswithout food in the pursuit of his cause, and endure tremendouspain for the sake of his convictions. But when you studyGandhi's life, you will see that he was not always a master ofself-control.\"    \"You're not going to tell me that Gandhi was a chocoholicare you?\"     \"Not quite, John. As a young lawyer in South Africa, he wasgiven to passionate outbursts and the disciplines of fasting andmeditation were as foreign to him as the simple white loinclothwhich eventually became his personal trademark in his later years.\"     \"Are you saying that with the right blend of training andpreparation, I could have the same level of willpower as MahatmaGandhi?\"     \"Everyone is different. One of the fundamental principles thatYogi Raman taught me was that truly enlightened people neverseek to be like others. Rather, they seek to be superior to theirformer selves. Don't race against others. Race against yourself,\"Julian replied.     \"When you have self-control, you will have the resolve to dothe things you have always wanted to do. For you, it may betraining for a marathon or mastering the art of white-waterrafting or even giving up the law to become an artist. Whatever itis you are dreaming of, whether it is material riches or spiritualriches, I will not be your judge. I will simply tell you that all thesethings will be within your grasp when you cultivate your sleepingreserves of willpower.\"     Julian added: \"Building self-control and discipline into yourlife will also bring you a tremendous sense of freedom. This alonewill change things.\"     \"What do you mean?\"     \"Most people have liberty. They can go where they want anddo the things they feel like doing. But too many people are alsoslaves to their impulses. They have grown reactive rather thanproactive, meaning that they are like seafoam pounding against arocky shore, going in whatever direction the tide might take them.If they are spending time with their families and someone fromwork calls with a crisis, they hit the ground running, neverstopping to think which activity is more vital to their overall well-being and to their life's purpose. So, after all I have observed inmy life, both here in the West and in the East, I say that suchpeople have liberty but lack freedom. They lack a key ingredientto a meaningful, enlightened life: the freedom to see the forestbeyond the trees, the freedom to choose what is right over whatseems pressing.\"    I couldn't help but agree with Julian. Sure, I had little tocomplain about. I had a great family, a cozy home and a bustlinglaw practice. But I really couldn't say that I had achieved freedom.My pager was just as much an appendage as my right arm. I wasalways on the run. I never seemed to have the time tocommunicate deeply with Jenny, and quiet time for myself in theforeseeable future was about as likely as me winning the BostonMarathon. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that Ihad probably never even tasted the nectar of true, boundlessfreedom when I was younger. I guess I really was a slave to myweaker impulses. I always did what everyone else told me I shouldbe doing.    \"And building willpower will offer me more freedom?\"    \"Freedom is like a house: you build it brick by brick. The firstbrick you should lay is willpower. This quality inspires you to dowhat is right in any given moment. It gives you the energy to actwith courage. It gives you the control to live the life you haveimagined rather than accepting the life that you have.\"    Julian also noted the many practical benefits that thecultivation of discipline would bring.    \"Believe it or not, developing the power of your will can erasethe worry habit, keep you healthy and give you far more energythan you have ever had. You see, John, self-control is really nothingmore than mind control. Will is the king of mental powers. Whenyou master your mind you master your life. Mental mastery startswith being able to control every thought that you think. When youhave developed the ability to discard all weak thoughts and focusonly on those that are positive and good, positive and good actionswill follow. Soon you will start attracting all that is positive andgood into your life.\"    \"Here's an example. Let's say one of your personaldevelopment goals is to get up every morning at 6:00 a.m. and gofor a run around that park behind your place. Let's pretend it isnow the middle of the winter, and your alarm wakes you from adeep, restful sleep. Your first impulse is to hit the snooze buttonand return to your slumber. Perhaps you will live up to yourexercise resolution tomorrow. This pattern continues for a fewdays until you decide that you are too old to change your ways andthe physical fitness goal was too unrealistic.\"    \"You know me too well,\" I offered sincerely.    \"Now let's consider an alternative scenario. It is still the deadof winter. The alarm goes off and you start to think of staying inbed. But instead of being a slave to your habits, you challengethem with more powerful thoughts. You start to picture in yourmind's eye how you will look, feel and act when you are in peakphysical shape. You hear the many compliments your colleagues atthe office offer you as you saunter past them with a svelte, trimphysique. You focus on all that you can accomplish with theincreased energy a regular exercise program will bring. No morenights spent in front of the television because you are too tired todo anything else after your long day in court. Your days are filledwith vitality, enthusiasm and meaning.\"     \"But say I do this and I still feel like going back to sleep ratherthan going running?\"     \"Initially, for the first few days, it will be a little difficult and youwill feel like going back to your old habits. But Yogi Raman believedvery strongly in one timeless principle in particular: positive alwaysovercomes negative. So if you continue to wage war against theweaker thoughts that might have silently crept into the palace ofyour mind over the years, eventually they will see that they areunwanted and leave like visitors who know they are not welcome.\"     \"You mean to tell me that thoughts are physical things?\"     \"Yes, and they are fully in your control. It is just as easy tothink positive thoughts as it is to think negative ones.\"     \"Then why do so many people worry and focus on all thenegative information in our world?\"     \"Because they have not learned the art of self-control anddisciplined thinking. Most people I have spoken to have no ideathat they have the power to control every single thought theythink every second of every minute of every day. They believe thatthoughts just happen and have never realized that if you don't takethe time to start controlling your thoughts, they will control you.When you start to focus on good thoughts only, and refuse to thinkthe bad ones through sheer will-power, I promise you they willshrivel up very quickly.\"     \"So, if I want to have the inner strength to get up earlier, eatless, read more, worry less, be more patient or be more loving, allI have to do is exert my will to cleanse my thoughts?\"     \"When you control your thoughts, you control your mind.When you control your mind, you control your life. And once youreach the stage of being in total control of your life, you becomethe master of your destiny.\"     I needed to hear this. Through the course of this strange yetinspiring evening I had gone from being a skeptical litigatorcarefully studying a hotshot lawyer-turned yogi to a believerwhose eyes had been opened for the first time in many years. Iwished Jenny could hear all this. Actually I wished my kids couldhear this wisdom too. I knew it would affect them as it had me. Ihad always planned on being a better family man and living morefully, but I always found that I was too busy putting out all thoselittle brush fires of life that seemed so pressing. Maybe this was aweakness, a lack of self-control. An inability to see the forest forthe trees, perhaps. Life was passing by so quickly. It seemed likejust yesterday that I was a young law student full of energy andenthusiasm. I dreamed of becoming a political leader or even asupreme court judge back then. But as time went by, I settled intoa routine. Even as a cocky litigator, Julian used to tell me that\"complacency kills.\" The more I thought about it, the more Irealized that I had lost my hunger. This wasn't a hunger for abigger house or a faster car. This was a far deeper hunger: ahunger for living with more meaning, with more festivity and moresatisfaction.     I started to daydream while Julian continued to talk. Obliviousto what he was now saying, I saw myself first as a fifty-year-old-and then as a sixty-year-old-man. Would I be stuck in the same jobwith the same people, facing the same struggles at that point of mylife? I dreaded that. I had always wanted to contribute to the worldin some way, and I sure wasn't doing it now. I think it was at thatmoment, with Julian sitting next to me on my living room floor onthat sticky July night that I changed. The Japanese call it satori,meaning instant awakening, and that's exactly what it was. Iresolved to fulfill my dreams and make my life far more than it hadever been. That was my first taste of real freedom, the freedomthat comes when you decide once and for all to take charge of yourlife and all its constituent elements.     \"I will give you a formula for developing willpower,\" saidJulian, who had no idea of the inner transformation I had justexperienced. \"Wisdom without proper tools for its application isno wisdom at all.\"     He continued. \"Every day, while you are walking to work, Iwould like you to repeat a few simple words.\"     \"Is this one of those mantras you told me about earlier?\" Iasked.     \"Yes it is. It is one that has been in existence for over fivethousand years, although only the small band of Sivanan monkshave known about it. Yogi Raman told me that by its repetition Iwould develop self-control and an indomitable will within a shortperiod of time. Remember, words are great influencers. Words arethe verbal embodiment of power. By filling your mind with wordsof hope, you become hopeful. By filling your mind with words ofkindness, you become kind. By filling your mind with thoughts ofcourage, you become courageous. Words have power,\" Julianobserved.     \"Okay, I'm all ears.\"     \"This is the mantra I suggest you repeat at least thirty timesa day: 'I am more than I appear to be, all the world's strength andpower rests inside me.' It will manifest profound changes in yourlife. For even quicker results, blend this mantra with the practiceof creative envisioning I spoke of earlier. For example, go to a quietplace. Sit with your eyes closed. Do not let your mind wander.Keep your body still, as the surest sign of a weak mind is a bodythat cannot rest. Now repeat the mantra aloud, over and overagain. While you do so, see yourself as a disciplined, firm person,fully in control of your mind, your body and your spirit. Pictureyourself acting as Gandhi or Mother Teresa might act in achallenging situation. Startling results will surely come your way,\"he promised.     \"That's it?\" I asked, astonished by the apparent simplicity ofthis formula. \"I can tap the full reserves of my willpower throughthis simple exercise?\"     \"This technique has been taught by the spiritual teachers ofthe East for centuries. It is still around today for one reason:because it works. As always, judge by results. If you areinterested, there are a couple of other exercises I can offer you toliberate the strength of your will and cultivate inner discipline. Butlet me warn you that they might seem strange at first.\"     \"Hey, Julian, I'm absolutely fascinated by what I've beenhearing. You're on a roll, so don't stop now.\"     \"Okay. The first thing is to start doing the things you don't likedoing. For you it might be as simple as making your bed in themorning or walking rather than driving to work. By getting intothe habit of exerting your will, you will cease to be a slave to yourweaker impulses.\"     \"Use it or lose it?\"     \"Exactly. To build willpower and inner strength you must firstuse it. The more you exert and nurture the embryo of self-discipline, the more quickly it will mature and give you the resultsyou desire. The second exercise is a favorite of Yogi Raman's. Heused to go an entire day without speaking, except in response to adirect question.\"     \"Kind of like a vow of silence?\"     \"Actually that's exactly what it was, John. The Tibetan monkswho popularized this practice believed that to hold one's tonguefor an extended period of time would have the effect of enhancingone's discipline.\"     \"But how?\"     \"Basically, by keeping silent for a day, you are conditioningyour will to do as you command it to do. Each time the urge tospeak arises, you actively curb this impulse and remain quiet. Yousee, your will does not have a mind of its own. It waits for you togive it instructions that will spur it into action. The more controlyou exert over it, the more powerful it will become. The problemis that most people don't use their willpower.\"     \"Why is that?\" I asked.     \"Probably because most people believe they don't have any.They blame everyone and everything except themselves for thisapparent weakness. Those who have a vicious temper will tell you,'I can't help it, my father was the same way.' Those who worry toomuch will tell you, 'It's not my fault, my job is too stressful.' Thosewho sleep too much will say, 'What can I do? My body needs tenhours of sleep a night.' Such people lack the self-responsibility thatcomes through knowing the extraordinary potential which liesdeep within every one of us, waiting to be inspired into action.When you come to know the timeless laws of nature, those thatgovern the operation of this universe and all that lives within it,you will also know that it is your birthright to be all that you canbe. You have the power to be more than your environment.Similarly, you have the capacity to be more than a prisoner of yourpast. To do this, you must become the master of your will.\"     \"Sounds heavy.\"     \"Really, it's a very practical concept. Imagine what you coulddo if you doubled or tripled the amount of willpower that youcurrently have. You could get into that exercise regimen you havedreamed of starting; you could be far more efficient with yourtime; you could erase the worry habit once and for all; or you couldbe the ideal husband. Using your will allows you to rekindle thedrive and energy for living that you seem to be saying you've lost.It is a very important area to focus on.\"     \"So the bottom line is to start using my willpower on a regularbasis?\"     \"Yes. Decide to do the things you know you should be doingrather than walking the path of least resistance. Start to fight thegravitational force of your bad habits and weaker impulses just asa rocket rises above the force of gravity to enter the realm of theheavens. Push yourself. Just watch what will happen in a matter ofweeks.\"     \"And the mantra will help?\"     \"Yes. Repeating the mantra I gave you, along with the dailypractice of seeing yourself as you hope to be, will give you anenormous amount of support as you create the disciplined,principled life that will connect you to your dreams. And you neednot change your world in a day. Start off small. The thousand-milejourney begins by taking that first step. We grow great bydegrees. Even training yourself to get up an hour earlier andsticking to this wonderful habit will boost your self-confidence,inspiring you to reach higher heights.\"     \"I don't see the connection,\" I admitted.     \"Small victories lead to large victories. You must build on thesmall to achieve the great. By following through on a resolution assimple as getting up earlier every day, you will feel the pleasureand gratification that achievement brings. You have set a goal andyou have realized it. This feels good. The trick is to keep settingthe mark higher and raising your standards continuously. This willthen release that magical quality of momentum that will motivateyou to keep exploring your infinite potential. Do you like to ski?\"Julian questioned abruptly.     \"I love skiing,\" I replied. \"Jenny and I take the kids up to themountains whenever we can, which isn't very often, much to herdismay.\"     \"Okay. Just think of what it's like when you push off from thetop of the ski hill. At first you start off slowly. But within a minuteyou are flying down the hill like there's no tomorrow. Right?\"     \"Just call me Ninja Skier. I love the rush of speed!\"     \"What gets you going so fast?\"     \"My aerodynamically contoured physique?\" I quipped.     \"Nice try.\" Julian laughed. \"Momentum is the answer I'mlooking for. Momentum is also the secret ingredient to buildingself-discipline. Like I said, you start off small, whether that meansgetting up a little earlier, starting to walk around the block everynight or even just training yourself to turn off the television whenyou know you have had enough. These small victories create themomentum that excites you to take larger steps along the path toyour highest self. Soon you are doing things that you never knewyou were capable of doing with a vigor and energy that you neverthought you had. It's a delightful process, John, it really is. Andthe pink wire cable in Yogi Raman's magical fable will alwaysremind you of the power of your will.\"     Just as Julian finished revealing his thoughts on the subject ofdiscipline, I noticed the first rays of the sun peeking into the livingroom, pushing away the darkness like a child pushes away anunwanted bedcover. \"This will be a great day,\" I thought. \"Thefirst day of the rest of my life.\"Chapter 10 Action Summary • Julian's Wisdom in a Nutshell  T he S y m b ol                           Live with Discipline  T he V i r t u e                           •   Discipline is built by consistently performing small acts of   T he W i s d om             courage                           •   The more you nurture the embryo of self-discipline, the                               more it will mature                           •   Willpower is the essential virtue of a fully actualized life                           •   Mantras / Creative EnvisioningT he T e c h n i q u e s                           •   The Vow of Silence                           Wage war against the weaker thoughts that have crept into theQuotable Quot e            palace of your mind. They will see that they are unwanted and                           leave like unwelcome visitors.                        CHAPTER ELEVEN             Your Most Precious                Commodity           Well arranged time is the surest mark of a well        arranged mind.                                             Sir Isaac Pitman\"You know what's funny about life?\" Julian asked me.    \"Tell me.\"    \"By the time most people figure out what they really want andhow to go about attaining it, it's usually too late. That saying, 'Ifyouth only knew, if age only could,\" is so true.    \"Is that what the stopwatch in Yogi Raman's fable is all about?\"    \"Yes. The naked nine-foot-tall, nine-hundred-pound sumowrestler with the pink wire cable covering his private parts slips ona shiny gold stopwatch that someone has left in the beautifulgarden,\" Julian reminded me.    \"How could I forget,\" I replied, breaking into a grin.    By now I had realized that Yogi Raman's mystical fable wasnothing more than a series of memory pegs designed to teachJulian the elements of his ancient philosophy for enlightened living,while at the same time helping him remember it. I shared mydiscovery with him.     \"Ah, the sixth sense of a litigator. You are quite right. My wiseteacher's methods appeared odd at first and I struggled tounderstand the significance of his tale just as you wondered what Iwas speaking of when I first shared it with you. But I must tell you,John, all seven elements of the story, from the garden and thenaked sumo wrestler to the yellow roses and the path of diamonds,which I am soon getting to, serve as powerful reminders of thewisdom I learned in Sivana. The garden keeps me focused oninspiring thoughts, the lighthouse reminds me that the purpose oflife is a life of purpose, the sumo wrestler keeps me centered oncontinuous self-discovery, while the pink wire cable links me to thewonders of will power. A day doesn't pass without me thinkingabout the fable and considering the principles Yogi Raman taughtme.\"    \"And exactly what does the shiny gold stopwatch represent?\"    \"It is a symbol of our most important commodity — time.\"    \"What about positive thinking and goal-getting and self-mastery?\"    \"They all mean nothing without time. About six months after Imade the delightful forest retreat in Sivana my temporary home,one of the sages came to my hut of roses while I was studying. Hername was Divea. She was a stunningly beautiful woman with jetblack hair that fell just below her waist, and in a very gentle andsweet voice she informed me that she was the youngest of all thesages living in that secret mountain abode. She also said that shehad come to me on the instructions of Yogi Raman who had told herthat I was the best student he had ever had.\"    \"'Maybe it is all the pain you suffered in your former life thathas allowed you to embrace our wisdom with such an open heart,'she stated. 'As the youngest of our community, I have been askedto bring you a gift. It is from all of us and we offer it as a token ofour respect for you, one who has travelled so far to learn our ways.At no point have you judged us or ridiculed our traditions. So,though you have now decided to leave us within a few weeks, weconsider you one of our own. No outsider has ever received what Iam about to give you.'\"    \"What was the gift?\" I asked impatiently.    \"Divea pulled out an object from her homespun cotton bag andhanded it to me. Wrapped in a fragrant cover of some type of paperwas something I never thought I'd see there in a million years. Itwas a miniature hourglass which had been made from blown glassand a small piece of sandalwood. Seeing my expression, Diveaquickly told me that each of the sages had received one of theseinstruments as children. \"Though we have no possessions and livepure, simple lives, we respect time and note its passing. These littlehourglasses serve as daily reminders of our mortality and theimportance of living full, productive days while advancing ourpurposes.'\"    \"These monks up in the highest reaches of the Himalayanmountains kept time?\"    \"Each and every one of them understood the importance oftime. They each had developed what I call a 'time consciousness.'You see, I learned that time slips through our hands like grains ofsand, never to return. Those who use time wisely from an early ageare rewarded with rich, productive and satisfying lives. Those whohave never been exposed to the principle that 'time mastery is lifemastery' will never realize their enormous human potential. Timeis the great leveller. Whether we are privileged or disadvantaged,whether we live in Texas or Tokyo, we all have been allotted dayswith only twenty-four hours. What separates those who buildexceptional lives from the 'also rans' is the way they use this time.\"     \"I once heard my father say that it was the busiest people whohave time to spare. What do you make of that?\"     \"I agree. Busy, productive people are highly efficient with theirtime — they must be in order to survive. Being an excellent timemanager doesn't mean that you must become a workaholic. On thecontrary, time mastery allows you more time to do the things youlove to do, the things that are truly meaningful to you. Timemastery leads to life mastery. Guard time well. Remember, it's anon-renewable resource.     \"Let me give you an example,\" Julian offered. \"Let's say it'sMonday morning and your schedule is overflowing withappointments, meetings and court appearances. Rather thangetting up at your usual 6:30 a.m., gulping down a cup of Java,speeding off to work and then spending a stressful day of'catchup,' let's say you took fifteen minutes the night before toplan your day. Or to be even more effective, let's say you took onehour on your quiet Sunday morning to organize your entire week.In your daily planner, you wrote out when you would meet withyour clients, when you would do legal research and when youwould return phone calls. Most importantly, your personal, socialand spiritual development goals for the week also went into youragenda book. This simple act is the secret to a life of balance. Byanchoring all the most vital aspects of your life into your dailyschedule, you ensure that your week and your life retain a sense ofmeaning and peace.\"     \"Surely you're not suggesting that I take a break in the middleof my busy work day to walk in the park or meditate?\"     \"I sure am. Why are you so rigidly bound to convention? Whydo you feel that you have to do things the same way as everyoneelse? Run your own race. Why not start working an hour earlierso that you will have the luxury of taking a serene mid-morningwalk in that beautiful park across from your office? Or why notput in a few extra hours at the beginning of your week so that youcan cut out early on Friday to take your kids to the zoo? Or whynot start working at home two days a week so that you can seemore of your family? All I'm saying is plan your week and manageyour time creatively. Have the discipline to focus your time aroundyour priorities. The most meaningful things in your life shouldnever be sacrificed to those that are the least meaningful. Andremember, failing to plan is planning to fail. By writing down notonly your appointments with others but also those all-importantappointments with yourself to read, relax or write a love letter toyour wife, you will be far more productive with your time. Neverforget that time spent enriching your non-work hours is never awaste. It makes you tremendously efficient during your workinghours. Stop living your life in compartments and understand onceand for all that all you do forms one indivisible whole. The way youact at home affects the way you act at work. The way you treatpeople at the office affects the way you will treat your family andfriends.\"     \"I agree, Julian, but I really don't have the time to take breaksin the middle of my day. As it is, I work most evenings. My scheduleis really crushing these days.\" As I said this, I felt my stomachtingling at the mere thought of the mountain of work I was facing.     \"Being busy is no excuse. The real question is, what are you sobusy about? One of the great rules I learned from that wise oldsage is that eighty percent of the results you achieve in your lifecome from only twenty percent of the activities that occupy yourtime. Yogi Raman called it the 'Ancient Rule of Twenty.'\"     \"I'm not sure I follow you.\"     \"Okay. Let's go back to your busy Monday. From morning untilnight you might spend your time doing everything from chattingon the phone with clients and drafting legal pleadings to readingyour youngest child a bedtime story or playing chess with yourwife. Agreed?\"     \"Agreed.\"     \"But out of all of the hundreds of activities you give your timeto, only twenty percent of those will yield real, lasting results. Onlytwenty percent of what you do will have an influence on the qualityof your life. These are your 'high-impact' activities. For example,ten years from now, do you really think all the time you spentgossiping at the water cooler or sitting in some smoke-filled lunchroom or watching television will count for anything?\"     \"No, not really.\"     \"Right. So I'm sure you will also agree there are a number ofactivities that will count for everything.\"     \"You mean like time spent improving my legal knowledge, timespent enriching my relationships with my clients and time investedin becoming a more efficient lawyer?\"     \"Yes, and time spent nourishing your relationship with Jennyand the kids. Time spent connecting with nature and showinggratitude for all that you are so fortunate to have. Time spentrenewing your mind, your body and your spirit. These are just afew of the high-impact activities that will allow you to design the lifeyou deserve. Direct all of your time to those activities that count.Enlightened people are priority driven. This is the secret of timemastery.\"     \"Wow. Yogi Raman taught you all that?\"     \"I have become a student of life, John. Yogi Raman certainlywas a wonderful and inspiring teacher and I will never forget himfor that. But all of the lessons I have learned from my variedexperiences have now come together like pieces of a big jigsawpuzzle to show me the way to a better life.\"     Julian added: \"I hope you will learn from my earlier mistakes.Some people learn from the errors others have made. They are thewise. Others feel that true learning comes only from personalexperience. Such people endure needless pain and distress overthe course of their lives.\"     I had been to many seminars on time management as a lawyer.Yet, I had never heard the philosophy of time mastery that Julianwas now sharing with me. Time management was not justsomething to focus on at the office and discard at closing time. Itwas a holistic system that could make all areas of my life morebalanced and fulfilling, if I applied it correctly. I learned that byplanning my days and taking the time to ensure that I wasbalanced in the use of my time, I would not only be far moreproductive — I would be far happier.     \"So life is like a fat strip of bacon,\" I chimed in. \"You have toseparate the meat from the fat in order to be the master of yourtime.\"     \"Very good. You're on to it now. And though my vegetarian sidetells me to do otherwise, I love the analogy because it hits the nailright on the head. When you spend your time and precious mentalenergy focusing on the meat, you have no time to waste on the fat.This is the point at which your life moves from the realm of theordinary into the exquisiteness of the extraordinary. This is whenyou really start to make things happen, and the doors to the templeof enlightenment suddenly swing open,\" Julian observed.    \"That brings me to another point. Don't let others steal yourtime. Be wary of time thieves. These are the people who always callon the telephone just as you have put the kids to sleep and havesettled into your favorite chair to read that thrilling novel you haveheard so much about. These are the people who have a knack ofdropping by your office just as you have found a few minutes in themidst of a hectic day to catch your breath and collect yourthoughts. Does this sound familiar?\"     \"As usual, Julian, you're right on the money. I guess I havealways been too polite to ask them to leave or to keep my doorshut,\" I confided.     \"You must be ruthless with your time. Learn to say no. Havingthe courage to say no to the little things in life will give you thepower to say yes to the big things. Shut the door to your officewhen you need a few hours to work on that big case. Rememberwhat I told you. Don't pick up the phone every time it rings. It isthere for your convenience, not the convenience of others.Ironically, people will respect you more when they see that you area person who values his time. They will realize that your time isprecious and they will value it.\"     \"What about procrastination? All too often I keep putting offthe things that I don't like doing and instead find myself siftingthrough junk mail or flipping though legal magazines. Maybe I'mjust killing time?\"     '\"Killing time' is an apt metaphor. True, it is human nature todo things that feel good and avoid the things that feel bad. But as Isaid earlier, the most productive people in this world havecultivated the habit of doing the things that less productive peopledon't like doing, even though they too might not like doing them.\"     I stopped and thought deeply about the principle I had justheard. Perhaps procrastination was not my problem. Maybe mylife had simply become too complex. Julian sensed my concern.     \"Yogi Raman told me that those who are masters of their timelive simple lives. A hurried, frenzied pace is not what natureintended. While he firmly believed that lasting happiness could bereached only by those who were effective and set definite aims forthemselves, living a life rich with accomplishment and contributiondid not have to come through the sacrifice of peace of mind. This iswhat I found so fascinating about the wisdom I was hearing. Itallowed me to be productive and yet fulfill my spiritual longings.\"    I started to open myself even more to Julian. \"You have alwaysbeen honest and forthright with me so I will be the same with you.I don't want to give up my practice and my house and my car to behappier and more satisfied. I like my toys and the material thingsI have earned. They are my rewards for all the hours I haveworked over the years since we first met. But I feel empty — Ireally do. I told you about my dreams when I was in law school.There is so much more I could do with my life. You know I'm almostforty and I have never been to the Grand Canyon or the EiffelTower. I've never walked in a desert or canoed across a still lake ona gorgeous summer's day. I have never once taken off my socksand shoes and walked barefoot through a park, listening to the kidslaugh and the dogs bark. I can't even remember the last time I tooka long, quiet walk by myself after a snowfall just to hear the soundsand to enjoy the sensations.\"   \"Then simplify your life.\" Julian suggested sympathetically.\"Apply the ancient Ritual of Simplicity to every aspect of yourworld. By doing so, you are bound to have more time to savor theseglorious wonders. One of the most tragic things that any one of uscan do is to put off living. Too many people are dreaming of somemagical rose garden on the horizon rather than enjoying the onegrowing in our back yards. What a tragedy.\"    \"Any suggestions?\"    \"That I will leave to your own imagination. I have shared manyof the strategies I learned from the sages with you. They will workwonders if you have the courage to apply them. Oh, that remindsme of another thing that I do to make sure my life stays calm andsimple.\"    \"What's that?\"    \"I love to have a quick nap in the afternoon. I find it keeps meenergetic, refreshed and youthful. I guess you could say that I needmy beauty sleep.\" Julian laughed.    \"Beauty has never been one of your strong points.\"    \"A sense of humor has always been one of yours, and for this Icommend you. Always remember the power of laughter. Likemusic, it is a wonderful tonic for life's stresses and strains. I thinkYogi Raman said it best when he said, \"Laughter opens your heartand soothes your soul. No one should ever take life so seriously thatthey forget to laugh at themselves.\"    Julian had one final thought to share on the subject of time.\"Perhaps most importantly, John, stop acting like you have fivehundred years to live. When Divea brought that little hourglass tome she offered some advice that I will never forget.\"    \"What did she say?\"    \"She told me that the best time to plant a tree was forty yearsago. The second best time is today. Don't waste even one minute ofyour day. Develop a deathbed mentality.\"     \"I beg your pardon?\" I asked, struck by the graphic termJulian had employed. \"What's a deathbed mentality?\"     \"It is a new way of looking at your life, a more empoweringparadigm if you will, one that reminds you that today could be yourlast, so savor it to the fullest.\"     \"Sounds kind of morbid, if you ask me. It makes me thinkabout death.\"     \"Actually, it's a philosophy about life. When you adopt adeathbed mentality you live every day as if it was your last.Imagine waking up every day and asking yourself the simplequestion: 'What would I do today if it was my last?' Then thinkabout how you would treat your family, your colleagues and eventhose who you don't know. Think about how productive and excitedyou would be to live every moment to the maximum. The deathbedquestion alone has the power to change your life. It will energizeyour days and bring a rush of zest and spirit to all that you do. Youwill start focusing on all the meaningful things that you have beenputting off, and stop squandering time on all those petty thingsthat have dragged you down into the quagmire of crisis and chaos.\"    Julian continued. \"Push yourself to do more and to experiencemore. Harness your energy to start expanding your dreams. Yes,expand your dreams. Don't accept a life of mediocrity when youhold such infinite potential within the fortress of your mind. Dareto tap into your greatness. This is your birthright!\"     \"Powerful stuff.\"     \"Here's more. There is a simple remedy to break the spell offrustration that plagues so many people.\"     \"My cup is still empty,\" I said softly.     \"Act as if failure is impossible, and your success will be assured.Wipe out every thought of not achieving your objectives, whetherthey are material or spiritual. Be brave, and set no limits on theworkings of your imagination. Never be a prisoner of your past.Become the architect of your future. You will never be the same.\"    As the city started to awaken, and the morning grew into fullbloom, my ageless friend started to show the first signs ofweariness after a night spent sharing his knowledge with an eagerstudent. I had been astonished by Julian's stamina, his boundlessenergy and his endless enthusiasm. He not only talked his talk —he walked his walk.    \"We are moving to the end of Yogi Raman's magical fable andapproaching the time when I must leave you,\" he said gently. \"Ihave much to do and many more people to meet.\"    \"Are you going to tell your partners that you have returnedhome?\" I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.    \"Probably not,\" Julian replied. \"I am so different from theJulian Mantle they knew. I don't think the same thoughts, I don'twear the same clothes, I don't do the same things. I am afundamentally changed person. They wouldn't recognize me.\"    \"You really are a new man,\" I agreed, chuckling inwardly as Ipictured this mystical monk adorned in the traditional robes ofSivana stepping into the striking red Ferrari of his former life.    \"A new being is probably even more accurate.\"    \"I don't see the distinction,\" I confessed.    \"There is an ancient saying in India: 'We are not human beingshaving a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having ahuman experience.' I now understand my role in the universe. I seewhat I am. I'm no longer in the world. The world is in me.\"    \"I'm going to have to chew on that one for a while,\" I said intotal honesty, not quite comprehending what Julian was talkingabout.     \"Sure. I understand, my friend. A time will come when you areclear on what I am saying. If you follow the principles I haverevealed to you and apply the techniques I have offered, you willsurely advance along the path of enlightenment. \"You will come tomaster the art of personal government. You will see your life forwhat it really is: a small blip on the canvas of eternity. And you willcome to see clearly who you are and the ultimate purpose of yourlife.\"     \"Which is?\"     \"To serve, of course. No matter how big a house you have orhow slick a car you drive, the only thing you can take with you atthe end of your life is your conscience. Listen to your conscience.Let it guide you. It knows what is right. It will tell you that yourcalling in life is ultimately selfless service to others in some form oranother. This is what my personal odyssey has taught me. Now, Ihave so many others to see, serve and heal. My mission is to spreadthe ancient wisdom of the Sages of Sivana to all those who need tohear it. This is my purpose.\"     The fire of knowledge had kindled Julian's spirit — this wasobvious, even to an unenlightened soul such as myself He was sopassionate, so committed and so fervent about what he was sayingthat it was reflected even in his physical dimension. Histransformation from a frail old litigator to a vital, young Adoniswas not brought about by a simple change in his diet and a dailydose of some quick-fix exercise plan. No, it was a far deeperpanacea that Julian had stumbled upon high in those majesticmountains. He had found the secret that people through the ageshave been searching for. It was more than the secret of youth,fulfillment or even happiness. Julian had discovered the secret ofthe Self.

CHAPTER TWELVE   The Ultimate Purpose of Life         Everything that lives, lives not alone, not for itself                                                William Blake\"The Sages of Sivana were not only the most youthful people Ihave ever met,\" observed Julian, \"they were also, without a doubt,the kindest.\"     \"Yogi Raman told me that when he was a child, as he waitedfor sleep, his father would step softly into his rose-covered hut andask him what good deeds he had performed through the course ofthat day. Believe it or not, if he said that he hadn't done any, hisfather would request that he get up and perform some act ofkindness and selfless service before he was permitted to go tosleep.\"     Julian went on. \"One of the most essential of all of the virtuesfor enlightened living that I can share with you, John, is this one:when all is said and done, no matter what you have achieved, nomatter how many summer homes you own, no matter how manycars sit in your driveway, the quality of your life will come down tothe quality of your contribution.\"     \"Does this have something to do with the fresh yellow roses inYogi Raman's fable?\"     \"Of course it does. The flowers will remind you of the ancientChinese proverb, \"a little bit of fragrance always clings to the handthat gives you roses.\" The meaning is clear — when you work toimprove the lives of others, you indirectly elevate your own life inthe process. When you take care to practice random acts ofkindness daily, your own life becomes far richer and moremeaningful. To cultivate the sacredness and sanctity of each day,serve others in some way.\"     \"Are you suggesting that I get involved in some volunteerwork?\"     \"That's an excellent starting point. But what I'm speaking of ismuch more philosophical than that. I'm suggesting that you adopta new paradigm of your role on this planet.\"     \"You're losing me again. Shed some light on the termparadigm. I'm not really familiar with it.\"     \"A paradigm is simply a way of looking at a circumstance or atlife in general. Some people see the glass of life as half empty. Theoptimists see it as half full. They interpret the same circumstancedifferently because they have adopted a different paradigm. Aparadigm is basically the lens through which you see the events ofyour life, both external and internal.\"     \"So when you suggest that I adopt a new paradigm of mypurpose, are you saying that I should change my outlook?\"     \"Sort of. To dramatically improve the quality of your life, youmust cultivate a new perspective of why you are here on Earth.You must realize that, just as you entered the world with nothing,you are destined to leave with nothing. This being the case, therecan be only one real reason for your being here.\"    \"And that would be?\"    \"To give yourself to others and to contribute in a meaningfulway,\" Julian replied. \"I'm not saying that you can't have your toysor that you must give up your law practice and devote your life tothe disadvantaged, although I have recently met people who havetaken this course of action with great satisfaction. Our world is inthe midst of great change. People are trading in money formeaning. Lawyers who used to judge people by the size of theirpocketbooks are now judging people by the size of theircommitment to others, by the size of their hearts. Teachers areleaving the wombs of their secure jobs to nurture the intellectualgrowth of needy kids living in the combat zones we call inner cities.People have heard the clear call for change. People are realizingthat they are here for a purpose and that they have been givenspecial gifts that will aid them to realize it.\"    \"What kind of special gifts?\"    \"Exactly the ones I have been telling you about all evening: anabundance of mental ability, boundless energy, unlimitedcreativity, a storehouse of discipline and a wellspring ofpeacefulness. It is simply a matter of unlocking these treasuresand applying them for some common good,\" noted Julian.    \"I'm still with you. So how can one go about doing good?\"    \"I'm simply saying that you should make it a priority tochange your world view so that you stop seeing yourself purely asan individual and start seeing yourself as part of the collective.\"    \"So I should become kinder and gentler?\"     \"Realize that the most noble thing you can do is to give toothers. The sages of the East call it the process of 'shedding theshackles of self.' It is all about losing your self-consciousness andstarting to focus on a higher purpose. This might be in the form ofgiving more to those around you, whether this means your time oryour energy: these truly are your two most valuable resources. Itcould be something as major as taking a one-year sabbatical towork with the poor or something as minor as letting a few carspass in front of you in the middle of a crushing traffic jam. It mightsound corny, but if there is one thing that I have learned it is thatyour life moves to a more magical dimension when you startstriving to make the world a better place. Yogi Raman said thatwhen we are born, we are crying while the world rejoices. Hesuggested that we should live our lives in such a way that when wedie, the world cries while we are rejoicing.\"    I knew Julian had a point. One of the things that was startingto bother me about practicing law was that I didn't really feel I wasmaking the sort of contribution I knew I was capable of making.Sure I had the privilege of litigating a number of precedent-settingcases that had advanced a number of good causes. But law hadbecome a business for me rather than a labor of love. I was anidealist in law school like so many of my contemporaries. Over coldcoffee and stale pizza in our dorm rooms, we had planned tochange the world. Almost twenty years have passed since then,and my burning desire to advocate change has given way to myburning desire to pay off my mortgage and build up my retirementfund. I realized, for the first time in a long while, that I hadensconced myself in a middle-class cocoon, one that sheltered mefrom society at large and one I had grown accustomed to.    \"Let me share an old story with you that might really hithome.\" Julian continued. \"There was once a feeble old womanwhose loving husband died. So she went to live with her son andhis wife and daughter. Every day, the woman's sight grew worseand her hearing grew worse. Some days her hands trembled sobadly the peas on her plate rolled onto the floor and the soup ranfrom her cup. Her son and his wife couldn't help but be annoyed atthe mess she made and one day they said enough was enough. Sothey set up a little table for the old woman in a corner next to thebroom closet and made her eat all of her meals there, alone. Shewould look at them at mealtimes with tear-filled eyes from acrossthe room, but they hardly talked to her while they ate, except toscold her for dropping a spoon or a fork.    \"One evening, just before dinner, the little girl was sitting onthe floor playing with her building blocks. 'What are you making?'her father asked earnestly. 'I'm building a little table for you andmother,' she said, 'so you can eat by yourselves in the cornersomeday when I get big.' The father and mother were moved tosilence for what seemed like an eternity. Then they started toweep. In that instant they became aware of the nature of theiractions and the sadness they had caused. That night they led theold woman back to her rightful place at their big dinner table andfrom that day on she ate all her meals with them. And when a littlemorsel of food fell off the table or a fork strayed onto the floor,nobody seemed to mind anymore.    \"In this story, the parents were not bad people,\" Julian said.\"They simply needed the spark of awareness to light their candleof compassion. Compassion and daily acts of kindness make life farricher. Take the time to meditate every morning on the good youwill do for others during your day. The sincere words of praise tothose who least expect it, the gestures of warmth offered tofriends in need, the small tokens of affection to members of yourfamily for no reason at all, all add up to a much more wonderfulway to live. And speaking of friendships, make sure you keep themin constant repair. A person with three solid friends is verywealthy indeed.\"    I nodded.    \"Friends add humor, fascination and beauty to life. There arefew things more rejuvenating than sharing a belly-bursting laughwith an old friend. Friends keep you humble when you get too self-righteous. Friends make you smile when you are taking yourselftoo seriously. Good friends are there to help you when life throwsone of its little curves at you and things look worse than they seem.When I was a busy litigator, I had no time for friends. Now I amalone, except for you, John. I have no one to take long walks in thewoods with when everyone else is nestled into the cocoon of a soft,hazy slumber. When I have just put down a wonderful book thathas moved me deeply, I have no one to share my thoughts with.And I have no one to open my soul to when the sunshine of aglorious autumn day warms my heart and fills me with joy.\"    Julian quickly caught himself. \"However, regret is not anactivity for which I have any time. I have learned from myteachers in Sivana that, 'Every dawn is a new day to the one whois enlightened.'\"    I had always viewed Julian as a sort of super-human legalgladiator, crunching through the arguments of his opponents as amartial artist does through a stack of heavily reinforced boards. Icould see that the man I had met many years ago had beentransformed into one of a very different nature. The one in front ofme was gentle, kind and peaceful. He seemed secure in who he wasand in his role in the theatre of life. Like no other person I had evermet, he seemed to see the pain of his past as a wise, old teacherand yet at the same time, he served notice that his life was farmore than the sum of events gone by.    Julian's eyes glittered in the hope of things yet to come. I wasenveloped by his sense of delight for the wonders of this world andcaught up in his unbridled joy for living. It appeared to me thatJulian Mantle, hard-hitting, bone-crunching litigation counsel tothe well-heeled, had indeed been elevated from a human beingpassing through life without a care for anyone, to a spiritual beingpassing through life caring only about others. Perhaps this was thepath that I too was about to walk.Chapter 12 Action Summary • Julian's Wisdom in a Nutshell  T he S y m b ol  T he V i r t u e         Selflessly Serve Others                           •   The quality of your life ultimately comes down to the   T he W i s d om             quality of your contribution                           •   To cultivate the sacredness of each day, live to give                           •   By elevating the lives of others, your life reaches its                               highest dimensions                           •   Practice Daily Acts of KindnessT he T e c h n i q u e s                           •   Give to Those Who Ask                           •   Cultivate Richer Relationships                           The most noble thing you can do is to give to others.

Mahatma GandhiIt had been over twelve hours since Julian had arrived at myhouse the night before to share the wisdom he had gathered inSivana. Those twelve hours were, without a doubt, the mostimportant of my life. All at once, I was feeling exhilarated,motivated and, yes, even liberated. Julian had fundamentallychanged my outlook on life with Yogi Raman's fable and theageless virtues that it represented. I realized that I had not evenbegun to explore the reaches of my human potential. I had beensquandering the daily gifts that life had thrown my way. Julian'swisdom had allowed me the opportunity to come to grips with thewounds that were keeping me from living with the laughter,energy and fulfillment I knew that I deserved. I felt moved.    \"I'll have to leave soon. You have commitments which arepressing on your time and I have my own work to tend to,\" Juliansaid apologetically.    \"My work can wait.\"    \"Unfortunately, mine can't,\" he said with a quick smile.    \"But before I leave, I must reveal the final element of \"YogiRaman's magical fable. You will recall that the sumo wrestler whowalked out of the lighthouse in the middle of a beautiful gardenwith nothing more than a pink wire cable covering his privateparts slipped on a shiny gold stopwatch and fell to the ground.After what seemed like an eternity, he finally regainedconsciousness when the marvellous fragrance of the yellow rosesreached his nose. He then jumped to his feet in delight and wasastonished to see a long, winding path studded with millions of tinydiamonds. Of course, our friend the sumo wrestler took the pathand, in doing so, lived happily ever after.\"     \"Seems plausible,\" I chuckled.     \"Yogi Raman had quite a vivid imagination, I'll agree. But youhave seen that his story has a purpose and that the principles itsymbolizes are not only powerful — they are highly practical.\"     \"True,\" I agreed without reservation.     \"The path of diamonds, then, will serve to remind you of thefinal virtue for enlightened living. By carrying this principle withyou through your daily work, you will enrich your life in a way thatis difficult for me to describe. You will begin to see the exquisitewonders in the simplest of things and live with the ecstacy youdeserve. And by carrying out your promise to me and sharing itwith others, you will also allow them to transform their world fromthe ordinary into the extraordinary.\"     \"Will this take me a while to learn?\"     \"The principle itself is strikingly straightforward to grasp.But learning how to apply it effectively in all your wakingmoments will take a couple of weeks of steady practice.\"     \"Okay, I'm dying to hear it.\"     \"Funny you say that because the seventh and final virtue is allabout living. The Sages of Sivana believed that a truly joyful andrewarding life comes only through a process they called 'living inthe now.' These yogis knew that the past is water under the bridgeand the future is a distant sun on the horizon of your imagination.The most important moment is now. Learn to live in it and savor itfully.\"    \"I understand exactly what you are saying, Julian. I seem tospend most of my day fretting over past events that I have nopower to change or worrying about things to come, which never doarrive. My mind is always flooded by a million little thoughtspulling me in a million different directions. It's really frustrating.\"     \"Why?\"     \"It tires me out! I guess I just don't have peace of mind. Yet Ihave experienced times when my mind is fully occupied on onlywhat was in front of me. Often this happened when I was underthe gun to crank out a legal brief and I didn't have time to thinkabout anything other than the task at hand. I've also felt this kindof total focus when I was playing soccer with the boys and I reallywanted to win. Hours seemed to pass by in minutes and I feltcentered. It was as if the only thing that mattered to me was whatI was doing in that very moment. Everything else, the worries, thebills, the law practice, didn't count. Come to think of it, these wereprobably the times when I felt the most peaceful as well.\"     \"Being engaged in a pursuit that truly challenges you is thesurest route to personal satisfaction. But the real key to rememberis that happiness is a journey, not a destination. Live for today —there will never be another one quite like it,\" stated Julian, hissmooth hands coming together as if to give a prayer of thanks forbeing privy to what he had just said.    \"Is that the principle that the path of diamonds in YogiRaman's fable symbolizes?\" I asked.    \"Yes,\" came the succinct reply. \"Just as the sumo wrestlerfound lasting fulfillment and joy by walking the path of diamonds,you can have the life you deserve the very moment you start tounderstand that the path you are currently walking on is one richwith diamonds and other priceless treasures. Stop spending somuch time chasing life's big pleasures while you neglect the littleones. Slow things down. Enjoy the beauty and sacredness of allthat is around you. You owe this to yourself.\"     \"Does that mean that I should stop setting big goals for myfuture and concentrate on the present?\"     \"No,\" replied Julian firmly. \"As I said earlier, goals and dreamsfor the future are essential elements in every truly successful life.Hope for what will appear in your future is what gets you out ofbed in the morning and what keeps you inspired through yourdays. Goals energize your life. My point is simply this: never putoff happiness for the sake of achievement. Never put off the thingsthat are important for your well-being and satisfaction to a latertime. Today is the day to live fully, not when you win the lottery orwhen you retire. Never put off living!\"     Julian stood up and started pacing back and forth across theliving room floor like a seasoned litigator releasing his final kernelsof reason in an impassioned closing argument. \"Don't fool yourselfinto thinking that you will be a more loving and giving husbandwhen your law firm takes on a few more junior lawyers to ease theburden. Don't kid yourself into believing that you will start toenrich your mind, care for your body and nourish your soul whenyour bank account gets big enough and you have the luxury ofmore free time. Today is the day to enjoy the fruits of your efforts.Today is the day to seize the moment and live a life that soars.Today is the day to live from your imagination and harvest yourdreams. And please never, ever forget the gift of family.\"    \"I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean Julian?\"    \"Live your children's childhood,\" came the simple reply.    \"Huh?\" I muttered, perplexed at the apparent paradox.    \"Few things are as meaningful as being a part of yourchildren's childhood. What is the point of climbing the steps ofsuccess if you have missed the first steps of your own kids? Whatgood is owning the biggest house on your block if you have nottaken the time to create a home? What is the use of being knownacross the country as a red-hot trial lawyer if your kids don't evenknow their father?\" Julian offered, his voice now quivering withemotion. \"I know whereof I speak.\"    This last comment floored me. All I knew of Julian was that hehad been a superstar litigator who hung out with the rich and thebeautiful. His romantic trysts with nubile fashion models werealmost as legendary as his courtroom skills. What could thisformer millionaire playboy possibly know about being a father?What could he possibly know about the daily struggles I faced intrying to be all things to all people, a great father and a successfullawyer? But Julian's sixth sense caught me.    \"I do know something of the blessings we call children,\" hesaid softly.      \"But I always thought you were the city's most eligiblebachelor before you threw in the towel and gave up your practice.\"      \"Before I was caught up in the illusion of that fast and furiouslifestyle that I was so well known for, you know that I was married.\"      \"Yes.\"      He then paused, as a child might before telling his best friend aclosely-guarded secret. \"What you do not know is that I also had alittle daughter. She was the sweetest, most delicate creature I haveever seen in my life. Back then, I was a lot like you were the firsttime we met: cocky, ambitious and full of hope. I had everythinganyone could ever want. People told me I had a brilliant future, astunningly beautiful wife and a wonderful daughter. Yet, when lifeseemed to be perfect, it was all taken from me in an instant.\"    For the first time since his return, Julian's eternally joyful facewas enveloped in sadness. A single tear began to slide down one ofhis bronzed cheeks and dripped onto the velvety fabric of his rubyred robe. I was speechless and gripped by the revelation of mylong-time friend.    \"You don't have to continue Julian,\" I offered sympathetically,placing an arm around his shoulder to comfort him.    \"But I do, John. Of all those I knew in my former life, youshowed the most promise. As I said, you reminded me a lot ofmyself when I was younger. Even now you still have so much goingfor you. But if you keep on living the way you're living, you areheaded for disaster. I came back to this place to show you thatthere are so many wonders waiting for you to explore, so manymoments left for you to savor.\"    \"The drunk driver who killed my daughter didn't take awayonly one precious life on that sun-soaked October afternoon — hetook two. After my daughter's passing, my life unravelled. Istarted spending every waking minute at the office, foolishlyhoping that my legal career might be the salve for the pain of abroken heart. Somedays, I even slept on a couch in my office,dreading to return to the home where so many sweet memorieshad been laid to rest. And while my career did take off, my innerworld was a mess. My wife, who had been my constant companionsince law school, left me, citing my obsession with my work as thestraw that broke the proverbial camel's back. My healthdeteriorated and I spiralled into the infamous life that I wasengaged in when we first met. Sure I had everything money couldpossibly buy. But I sold my soul for it, I really did,\" Julian notedemotionally, his voice still choked up.    \"So when you say 'Live your children's childhood,' you arebasically telling me to take the time to watch them grow andflourish. That's it, isn't it?\"    \"Even today, twenty-seven years after she left us while wewere driving her to her best friend's birthday party, I would giveanything just to hear my daughter giggle again or to play hide-and-seek like we used to in our back garden. I would love to holdher in my arms and softly caress her golden hair. She took a pieceof my heart with her when she left. And though my life has beeninspired by new meaning since I found the way to enlightenmentand self-leadership in Sivana, a day doesn't pass without me seeingthe rosy face of my sweet little girl in the silent theatre of mymind. You have such great kids, John. Don't miss the forest for thetrees. The best gift you could ever give your children is your love.Get to know them again. Show them that they are far moreimportant to you than the fleeting rewards of your professionalcareer. Pretty soon they will be off, building lives and families oftheir own. Then it will be too late, the time will be gone.\"    Julian had struck a chord deep inside of me. I guess I hadknown for some time that my workaholic pace was slowly butsteadily loosening our family's ties. But it was like a smolderingember, burning quietly, slowly gathering its energy beforerevealing the full extent of its destructive potential. I knew mykids needed me, even if they might not have told me so. I neededto hear this from Julian. Time was slipping by and they weregrowing up so quickly. I couldn't remember the last time my sonAndy and I had stolen off early on a crisp Saturday morning tospend the day at the fishing hole his grandfather loved so much.There was a time when we would go every weekend. Now, thistime-honored ritual seemed like someone else's memory.    The more I thought about it, the harder it hit me. Pianorecitals, Christmas plays, little-league championships had all beentraded for my professional advancement.    'What was I doing?' I wondered. I really was sliding down theslippery slope that Julian described. There and then, I resolved tochange.    \"Happiness is a journey,\" Julian continued, his voice risingonce again with the heat of passion. \"It is also a choice that youmake. You can marvel at the diamonds along the way or you cankeep running through all your days, chasing that elusive pot ofgold at the end of the rainbow that ultimately reveals itself to beempty. Enjoy the special moments that every day offers becausetoday, this day is all you have.\"    \"Can anyone learn to 'live in the now'?\"    \"Absolutely. No matter what your current circumstancesmight be, you can train yourself to enjoy the gift of living and fillyour existence with the jewels of everyday life.\"    \"But isn't that a little optimistic. How about someone who hasjust lost everything they own due to a bad business deal. Let's saythat not only are they financially bankrupt but emotionallybankrupt as well?\"     \"The size of your bank account and the size of your house havenothing to do with living life with a sense of joy and wonder. Thisworld is full of unhappy millionaires. Do you think the sages I metin Sivana were concerned with having a well-balanced financialportfolio and acquiring a summer home in the South of France?\"Julian asked mischievously.     \"Okay. I see your point.\"     \"There is a huge difference between making a lot of moneyand making a lot of life. When you start spending even fiveminutes a day practicing the art of gratitude, you will cultivate therichness of living that you are looking for. Even the person youspoke of in your example can find an abundance of things to bethankful for, notwithstanding his dire financial predicament. Askhim if he still has his health, his loving family and his goodreputation in the community. Question him as to whether he ishappy to have citizenship in this great country and whether he stillhas a roof over his head. Perhaps he might have no assets otherthan a masterful ability to work hard and the ability to dream bigdreams. Yet these are precious assets for which he ought to begrateful. We all have much to be thankful for. Even the birdssinging outside your windowsill on what looks like anothermagnificent summer's day appear as a gift to the wise person.Remember, John, life doesn't always give you what you ask for, butit always gives you what you need.\"     \"So by giving daily thanks for all of my assets, whether theseare material or spiritual, I will develop the habit of living in themoment?\"    \"Yes. This is an effective method for putting far more livinginto your life. When you savor the 'now,' you kindle the fire of lifethat allows you to grow your destiny.\"    \"Grow my destiny?\"    \"Yes. I told you earlier that we all have been given certaintalents. Every single person on the planet is a genius.\"    \"You don't know some of the lawyers I work with,\" I quipped.    \"Everyone,\" said Julian emphatically. \"We all have somethingthat we are meant to do. Your genius will shine through, andhappiness will fill your life, the instant you discover your higherpurpose and then direct all your energies towards it. Once you areconnected to this mission, whether it is being a great teacher ofchildren or an inspired artist, all your desires will be fulfilledeffortlessly. You will not even have to try. As a matter of fact, theharder you try, the longer it will take you to reach your aims.Instead, simply follow the path of your dreams, in full expectationof the bounty that is certain to flow. This will bring you to yourdivine destination. This is what I mean by growing your destiny,\"Julian offered sagely.     \"When I was a young boy, my father loved to read me a fairytale known as 'Peter and the Magic Thread.' Peter was a very livelylittle boy. Everyone loved him: his family, his teachers and hisfriends. But he did have one weakness.\"     \"What was that?\"     \"Peter could never live in the moment He had not learned toenjoy the process of life. When he was in school, he dreamed ofbeing outside playing. When he was outside playing he dreamed ofhis summer vacation. Peter constantly daydreamed, never takingthe time to savor the special moments that filled his days. Onemorning, Peter was out walking in a forest near his home. Feelingtired, he decided to rest on a patch of grass and eventually dozedoff. After only a few minutes of deep sleep, he heard someonecalling his name. 'Peter! Peter!' came the shrill voice from above.As he slowly opened his eyes, he was startled to see a strikingwoman standing above him. She must have been over a hundredyears old and her snow-white hair dangled well below hershoulders like a matted blanket of wool. In this woman's wrinkledhand was a magical little ball with a hole in the center and out ofthe hole dangled a long, golden thread.\"    \"'Peter,' she said, this is the thread of your life. If you pull thethread just a bit, an hour will pass in seconds. If you pull a littleharder, whole days will pass in minutes. And if you pull with allyour might, months — even years — will pass by in days.' Petergrew very excited at this discovery. 'I'd like to have it if I may?' heasked. The elderly woman quickly reached down and gave the ballwith the magic thread to the young boy.    The next day, Peter was sitting in the classroom feelingrestless and bored. Suddenly, he remembered his new toy. As hepulled a little bit of the golden thread, he quickly found himself athome, playing in his garden. Realizing the power of the magicthread, Peter soon grew tired of being a schoolboy and longed tobe a teenager, with all the excitement that phase of life wouldbring. So again he pulled out the ball and pulled hard on the goldenthread.     Suddenly he was a teenager with a very pretty younggirlfriend named Elise. But Peter still wasn't content. He hadnever learned to enjoy the moment and to explore the simplewonders of every stage of his life. Instead, he dreamed of being anadult. So again he pulled on the thread and many years whizzed byin an instant. Now he found that he had been transformed into amiddle-aged adult. Elise was now his wife and Peter wassurrounded with a houseful of kids. But Peter also noticedsomething else. His once jet black hair had started to turn grey.And his once youthful mother whom he loved so dearly had grownold and frail. Yet Peter still could not live in the moment. He hadnever learned to 'live in the now' So, once again, he pulled on themagic thread and waited for the changes to appear.     Peter now found that he was a ninety-year-old man. His thickdark hair had turned white as snow and his beautiful young wifeElise had also grown old and had passed away a few years earlier.His wonderful children had grown up and left home to lead livesof their own. For the first time in his entire life, Peter realized thathe had not taken the time to embrace the wonders of living. Hehad never gone fishing with his kids or taken a moonlight strollwith Elise. He had never planted a garden or read thosewonderful books his mother had loved to read. Instead, he hadhurried through life, never resting to see all that was good alongthe way.     Peter became very sad at this discovery. He decided to go outto the forest where he used to walk as a boy to clear his head andwarm his spirit. As he entered the forest, he noticed that the littlesaplings of his childhood had grown into mighty oaks. The forestitself had matured into a paradise of nature. He lay down on asmall patch of grass and fell into a deep slumber. After only aminute, he heard someone calling out to him. 'Peter! Peter!' criedthe voice. He looked up in astonishment to see that it was noneother than the old woman who had given him the ball with themagic golden thread many years earlier.    'How have you enjoyed my special gift?' she asked.    Peter was direct in his reply.     'At first it was fun but now I hate it. My whole life has passedbefore my eyes without giving me the chance to enjoy it. Sure,there would have been sad times as well as great times but Ihaven't had the chance to experience either. I feel empty inside. Ihave missed the gift of living.'     'You are very ungrateful,' said the old woman. 'Still, I will giveyou one last wish.'     Peter thought for an instant and then answered hastily. 'I'dlike to go back to being a schoolboy and live my life over again.' Hethen returned to his deep sleep.    Again he heard someone calling his name and opened his eyes.'Who could it be this time?' he wondered. When he opened hiseyes, he was absolutely delighted to see his mother standing overhis bedside. She looked young, healthy and radiant. Peter realizedthat the strange woman of the forest had indeed granted his wishand he had returned to his former life.     'Hurry up Peter. You sleep too much. Your dreams will makeyou late for school if you don't get up right this minute,' his motheradmonished. Needless to say, Peter dashed out of bed on thismorning and began to live the way he had hoped. Peter went on tolive a full life, one rich with many delights, joys and triumphs, butit all started when he stopped sacrificing the present for the futureand began to live in the moment.\"     \"Amazing story,\" I said softly.     \"Unfortunately, John, the story of Peter and the Magic Threadis just that, a story, a fairy tale. We here in the real world will neverget a second chance to live life to the fullest. Today is your chanceto awaken to the gift of living — before it is too late. Time reallydoes slip through your fingers like tiny grains of sand. Let thisnew day be the defining moment of your life, the day that youmake the decision once and for all to focus on what is trulyimportant to you. Make the decision to spend more time with thosewho make your life meaningful. Revere the special moments, revelin their power. Do the things that you have always wanted to do.Climb that mountain you have always wanted to climb or learn toplay the trumpet. Dance in the rain or build a new business. Learnto love music, learn a new language and rekindle the delight ofyour childhood. Stop putting off your happiness for the sake ofachievement. Instead, why not enjoy the process? Revive yourspirit and start tending to your soul. This is the way to Nirvana.\"     \"Nirvana?\"     \"The Sages of Sivana believed that the ultimate destination ofall truly enlightened souls was a place called Nirvana. Actually,more than a place, the sages believed Nirvana to be a state, onethat transcended anything they had known previously. In Nirvana,all things were possible. There was no suffering and the dance oflife was played out with divine perfection. On reaching Nirvana,the sages felt that they would step into Heaven on Earth. This wastheir ultimate goal in life,\" Julian observed, his face radiating apeaceful, almost angelic quality.    \"We are all here for some special reason,\" he observedprophetically. \"Meditate on what your true calling is, and how youcan give of yourself to others. Stop being a prisoner of gravity.Today, light your spark of life and let it blaze brightly. Startapplying the principles and strategies that I have shared with you.Be all that you can be. A time will come when you too will taste thefruits of that place called Nirvana.\"    \"How will I know when I reach this state of enlightenment?\"    \"Little hints will appear to confirm your entrance. You willstart to notice the holiness in everything that is around you: thedivinity of a moonbeam, the allure of a lush blue sky on a scorchingsummer day, the fragrant bloom of a daisy or the laugh of amischievous little child.\"     \"Julian, I promise you that the time you have spent with mewill not be in vain. I will dedicate myself to living by the wisdom ofthe Sages of Sivana and I will keep my promise to you by sharingall that I have learned with those who will benefit by yourmessage. I am speaking from the heart. I give you my word,\" Ioffered sincerely, feeling the throes of emotion stirring within.     \"Spread the rich legacy of the sages to all those around you.They will quickly benefit from this knowledge and improve thequality of their lives, just as you will improve the quality of yours.And remember, the journey is to be enjoyed. The road is just asgood as the end.\"     I let Julian continue. \"Yogi Raman was a great storyteller butthere was one story he told me which stood out amongst the rest.May I share it with you?\"     \"Absolutely.\"     \"Many years ago, in ancient India, a maharajah wanted tobuild a great tribute to his wife as a sign of his deep love andaffection for her. This man wanted to create a structure thelikes of which the world had never seen, one that would shimmeracross the moonlit sky, one that people would admire for centuriesto come. So every day, block by block, his workers toiled in the hotsun. Every day this structure started to look a little more defined,a little more like a monument, a little more like a beacon of loveagainst the azure blue Indian sky. Finally, after twenty-two yearsof daily, gradual progress, this palace of pure marble wascomplete. Guess what I'm speaking of?\"     \"I have no idea.\"     \"The Taj Mahal. One of the Seven Wonders of the World,\"Julian replied. \"My point is simple. Everyone on this planet is awonder of this world. Every one of us is a hero in some way oranother. Every one of us has the potential for extraordinaryachievement, happiness and lasting fulfillment. All it takes aresmall steps in the direction of our dreams. Like the Taj Mahal, alife overflowing with wonders is built day by day, block by block.Small victories lead to large victories. Tiny, incremental changesand improvements such as those I have suggested will createpositive habits. Positive habits will create results. And results willinspire you towards greater personal change. Begin to live eachday as if it was your last. Starting today, learn more, laugh moreand do what you truly love to do. Do not be denied your destiny.For what lies behind you and what lies in front of you matters littlewhen compared to what lies within you.\"     Without saying another word, Julian Mantle, the millionairelawyer-turned enlightened monk, got up, embraced me like thebrother he had never had and walked out of my living room intothe thick heat of another scorching summer day. As I sat alone andcollected my thoughts, I noticed that the only evidence I could findof this sage messenger's extraordinary visit sat silently on thecoffee table in front of me. It was his empty cup. Chapter 13 Action Summary • Julian's Wisdom in a Nutshell  T he S y m b ol  T he V i r t u e         Embrace the Present                           •   Live in the \"now\".

he wasone of this countrys most distinguished trial lawyers he was alsoa man who was as well known for the threethousanddollar italiansuits which draped his wellfed frame as for his remarkable stringof legal victories i simply stood there paralyzed by the shock ofwhat i had just witnessed the great julian mantle had beenreduced to a victim and was now squirming on the ground like ahelpless infant shaking and shivering and sweating like a maniac     everything seemed to move in slow motion from that point onmy god julians in trouble his paralegal screamed emotionallyoffering us a blinding glimpse of the obvious the judge lookedpanicstricken and quickly muttered something into the privatephone she had had installed in the event of an emergency as forme i could only stand there dazed and confused please dont dieyou old fool its too early for you to check out you dont deserveto die like this     the bailiff who earlier had looked as if he had been embalmedin his standing position leapt into action and started to performcpr on the fallen legal hero the paralegal was at his side herlong blond curls dangling over julians rubyred face offering himsoft words of comfort words which he obviously could not hear     i had known julian for seventeen years we had first met wheni was a young law student hired by one of his partners as a summerresearch intern back then hed had it all he was a brilliant handsome and fearless trial attorney with dreams of greatness julianwas the firms young star the rainmaker in waiting i can stillremember walking by his regal corner office while i was workinglate one night and stealing a glimpse of the framed quotationperched on his massive oak desk it was by winston churchill andit spoke volumes about the man that julian was    sure i am that this day we are masters of our fate that the    task which has been set before us is not above our strength    that its pangs and toils are not beyond my endurance as    long as we have faith in our own cause and an uncon    querable will to win victory will not be denied us    julian also walked his talk he was tough harddriving andwilling to work eighteenhour days for the success he believed washis destiny i heard through the grapevine that his grandfatherhad been a prominent senator and his father a highly respectedjudge of the federal court it was obvious that he came frommoney and that there were enormous expectations weighing on hisarmaniclad shoulders ill admit one thing though he ran his ownrace he was determined to do things his own way — and he lovedto put on a show   julians outrageous courtroom theatrics regularly made the frontpages of the newspapers the rich and famous flocked to his sidewhenever they needed a superb legal tactician with an aggressiveedge his extracurricular activities were probably as well knownlatenight visits to the citys finest restaurants with sexy young fashion models or reckless drinking escapades with the rowdy band ofbrokers he called his demolition team became the stuff of legend atthe firm     i still cant figure out why he picked me to work with him onthat sensational murder case he was to argue that first summerthough i had graduated from harvard law school his almamater i certainly wasnt the brightest intern at the firm and myfamily pedigree reflected no blue blood my father spent his wholelife as a security guard with a local bank after a stint in themarines my mother grew up unceremoniously in the bronx     yet he did pick me over all the others who had been quietlylobbying him for the privilege of being his legal gofer on whatbecame known as the mother of all murder trials he said heliked my hunger we won of course and the business executivewho had been charged with brutally killing his wife was now a freeman — or as free as his cluttered conscience would let him be     my own education that summer was a rich one it was farmore than a lesson on how to raise a reasonable doubt where noneexisted — any lawyer worth his salt could do that this was alesson in the psychology of winning and a rare opportunity towatch a master in action i soaked it up like a sponge     at julians invitation i stayed on at the firm as an associateand a lasting friendship quickly developed between us i willadmit that he wasnt the easiest lawyer to work with serving ashis junior was often an exercise in frustration leading to morethan a few latenight shouting matches it was truly his way or thehighway this man could never be wrong however beneath hiscrusty exterior was a person who clearly cared about people    no matter how busy he was he would always ask about jennythe woman i still call my bride even though we were marriedbefore i went to law school on finding out from another summerintern that i was in a financial squeeze julian arranged for me toreceive a generous scholarship sure he could play hardball withthe best of them and sure he loved to have a wild time but henever neglected his friends the real problem was that julian wasobsessed with work    for the first few years he justified his long hours by saying thathe was doing it for the good of the firm and that he planned totake a month off and go to the caymans next winter for sure astime passed however julians reputation for brilliance spread andhis workload continued to increase the cases just kept on gettingbigger and better and julian never one to back down from a goodchallenge continued to push himself harder and harder in his raremoments of quiet he confided that he could no longer sleep formore than a couple of hours without waking up feeling guilty thathe was not working on a file it soon became clear to me that he wasbeing consumed by the hunger for more more prestige more gloryand more money    as expected julian became enormously successful heachieved everything most people could ever want a stellar professional reputation with an income in seven figures a spectacularmansion in a neighborhood favored by celebrities a private jet asummer home on a tropical island and his prized possession — ashiny red ferrari parked in the center of his driveway    yet i knew that things were not as idyllic as they appeared onthe surface i observed the signs of impending doom not because iwas so much more perceptive than the others at the firm butsimply because i spent the most time with the man we werealways together because we were always at work things neverseemed to slow down there was always another blockbuster caseon the horizon that was bigger than the last no amount of preparation was ever enough for julian what would happen if thejudge brought up this question or that question god forbid whatwould happen if our research was less than perfect what wouldhappen if he was surprised in the middle of a packed courtroomlooking like a deer caught in the glare of an intruding pair of headlights so we pushed ourselves to the limit and i got sucked intohis little workcentered world as well there we were two slavesto the clock toiling away on the sixtyfourth floor of some steel andglass monolith while most sane people were at home with theirfamilies thinking we had the world by the tail blinded by an illusory version of success     the more time i spent with julian the more i could see thathe was driving himself deeper into the ground it was as if he hadsome kind of a death wish nothing ever satisfied him eventuallyhis marriage failed he no longer spoke with his father and thoughhe had every material possession anyone could want he still hadnot found whatever it was that he was looking for itshowed emotionally physically — and spiritually     at fiftythree years of age julian looked as if he was in hislate seventies his face was a mass of wrinkles a less than glorious tribute to his take no prisoners approach to life in generaland the tremendous stress of his outofbalance lifestyle in particular the latenight dinners in expensive french restaurantssmoking thick cuban cigars and drinking cognac after cognachad left him embarrassingly overweight he constantlycomplained that he was sick and tired of being sick and tired hehad lost his sense of humor and never seemed to laugh anymorejulians once enthusiastic nature had been replaced by a deathlysomberness personally i think that his life had lost all sense ofpurpose     perhaps the saddest thing was that he had also lost his focus inthe courtroom where he would once dazzle all those present withan eloquent and airtight closing argument he now droned on forhours rambling about obscure cases that had little or no bearingon the matter before the court where once he would react gracefully to the objections of opposing counsel he now displayed abiting sarcasm that severely tested the patience of judges who hadearlier viewed him as a legal genius simply put julians spark oflife had begun to flicker     it wasnt just the strain of his frenetic pace that was markinghim for an early grave i sensed it went far deeper it seemed tobe a spiritual thing almost every day he would tell me that he feltno passion for what he was doing and was enveloped by emptinessjulian said that as a young lawyer he really loved the law eventhough he was initially pushed into it by the social agenda of hisfamily the laws complexities and intellectual challenges hadkept him spellbound and full of energy its power to effect socialchange had inspired and motivated him back then he was morethan just some rich kid from connecticut he really saw himselfas a force for good an instrument for social improvement whocould use his obvious gifts to help others that vision gave his lifemeaning it gave him a purpose and it fuelled his hopes     there was even more to julians undoing than a rustyconnection to what he did for a living he had suffered somegreat tragedy before i had joined the firm something trulyunspeakable had happened to him according to one of the seniorpartners but i couldnt get anyone to open up about it even oldman harding the notoriously looselipped managing partnerwho spent more time in the bar of the ritzcarlton than in hisembarrassingly large office said that he was sworn to secrecywhatever this deep dark secret was i had a suspicion that it insome way was contributing to julians downward spiral sure iwas curious but most of all i wanted to help him he was notonly my mentor he was my best friend    and then it happened this massive heart attack that broughtthe brilliant julian mantle back down to earth and reconnectedhim to his mortality right in the middle of courtroom numberseven on a monday morning the same courtroom where we hadwon the mother of all murder trials                           chapter two          the mysterious visitorit was an emergency meeting of all of the firms members as wesqueezed into the main boardroom i could tell that there was aserious problem old man harding was the first to speak to theassembled mass     im afraid i have some very bad news julian mantle suffereda severe heart attack in court yesterday while he was arguing theair atlantic case he is currently in the intensive care unit but hisphysicians have informed me that his condition has now stabilizedand he will recover however julian has made a decision one thati think you all must know he has decided to leave our family andto give up his law practice he will not be returning to the firm     i was shocked i knew he was having his share of troubles buti never thought he would quit as well after all that we had beenthrough i thought he should have had the courtesy to tell me thispersonally he wouldnt even let me see him at the hospital everytime i dropped by the nurses had been instructed to tell me thathe was sleeping and could not be disturbed he even refused to takemy telephone calls maybe i reminded him of the life he wanted toforget who knows ill tell you one thing though it hurt     that whole episode was just over three years ago last iheard julian had headed off to india on some kind of an expedition he told one of the partners that he wanted to simplify hislife and that he needed some answers and hoped he would findthem in that mystical land he had sold his mansion his planeand his private island he had even sold his ferrari julianmantle as an indian yogi i thought the law works in themost mysterious of ways    as those three years passed i changed from an overworkedyoung lawyer to a jaded somewhat cynical older lawyer my wifejenny and i had a family eventually i began my own search formeaning i think it was having kids that did it they fundamentallychanged the way i saw the world and my role in it my dad said itbest when he said john on your deathbed you will never wishyou spent more time at the office so i started spending a littlemore time at home i settled into a pretty good if ordinary existence i joined the rotary club and played golf on saturdays tokeep my partners and clients happy but i must tell you in myquiet moments i often thought of julian and wondered what hadbecome of him in the years since we had unexpectedly partedcompany     perhaps he had settled down in india a place so diverse thateven a restless soul like his could have made it his home or maybehe was trekking through nepal scuba diving off the caymansone thing was certain he had not returned to the legal professionno one had received even a postcard from him since he left for hisselfimposed exile from the law    a knock on my door about two months ago offered the firstanswers to some of my questions i had just met with my lastclient of a gruelling day when genevieve my brainy legalassistant popped her head into my small elegantly furnishedoffice    theres someone here to see you john he says its urgentand that he will not leave until he speaks with you     im on my way out the door genevieve i replied impatientlyim going to grab a bite to eat before finishing off the hamiltonbrief i dont have time to see anyone right now tell him to makean appointment like everyone else and call security if he gives youany more trouble     but he says he really needs to see you he refuses to take nofor an answer     for an instant i considered calling security myself butrealizing that this might be someone in need i assumed a moreforgiving posture    okay send him in i retreated i probably could use the business anyway     the door to my office opened slowly at last it swung fullyopen revealing a smiling man in his midthirties he was tall leanand muscular radiating an abundance of vitality and energy hereminded me of those perfect kids i went to law school with fromperfect families with perfect houses perfect cars and perfect skinbut there was more to my visitor than his youthful good looks anunderlying peacefulness gave him an almost divine presence andhis eyes piercing blue eyes that sliced clear through me like arazor meeting the supple flesh of a freshfaced adolescent anxiousabout his first shave    another hotshot lawyer gunning for my job i thought to myselfgood grief why is he just standing there looking at me i hope thatwasnt his wife i represented on that big divorce case i won last weekmaybe calling security wasnt such a silly idea after all    the young man continued to look at me much as the smilingbuddha might have looked upon a favored pupil after a longmoment of uncomfortable silence he spoke in a surprisinglycommanding tone    is this how you treat all of your visitors john even those whotaught you everything you know about the science of success in acourtroom i should have kept my trade secrets to myself hesaid his full lips curving into a mighty grin    a strange sensation tickled the pit of my stomach i immediately recognized that raspy honeysmooth voice my heart startedto pound    julian is that you i cant believe it is that really you    the loud laugh of the visitor confirmed my suspicions theyoung man standing before me was none other than that longlostyogi of india julian mantle i was dazzled by his incredible transformation gone was the ghostlike complexion the sickly coughand the lifeless eyes of my former colleague gone was the elderlyappearance and the morbid expression that had become hispersonal trademark instead the man in front of me appeared tobe in peak health his lineless face glowing radiantly his eyes werebright offering a window into his extraordinary vitality perhapseven more astounding was the serenity that julian exuded i feltentirely peaceful just sitting there staring at him he was nolonger an anxious typea senior partner of a leading law firminstead the man before me was a youthful vital — and smiling—model of change                         chapter three        the miraculoustransformation of julian mantlei was astonished by the new and improved julian mantle    how could someone who looked like a tired old man only afew short years ago now look so vibrant and alive i wondered insilent disbelief was it some magical drug that had allowed him todrink from the fountain of youth what was the cause of thisextraordinary reversal    julian was the first to speak he told me that the hypercompetitive legal world had taken its toll on him not only physically and emotionally but spiritually the fast pace and endlessdemands had worn him out and run him down he admitted thathis body had fallen apart and that his mind had lost its lustre hisheart attack was only one symptom of a deeper problem theconstant pressure and exhausting schedule of a worldclass triallawyer had also broken his most important—and perhaps mosthuman—endowment his spirit when given the ultimatum by hisdoctor either to give up the law or give up his life he said he sawa golden opportunity to rekindle the inner fire he had knownwhen he was younger a fire that had been extinguished as thelaw became less a pleasure and more a business    julian grew visibly excited as he recounted how he sold all hismaterial possessions and headed for india a land whose ancientculture and mystical traditions had always fascinated him hetravelled from tiny village to tiny village sometimes by foot sometimes by train learning new customs seeing the timeless sightsand growing to love the indian people who radiated warmth kindness and a refreshing perspective on the true meaning of lifeeven those who had very little opened their homes — and theirhearts — to this weary visitor from the west as the days meltedinto weeks within this enchanting environment julian slowlybegan to feel alive and whole again perhaps for the first time sincehe was a child his natural curiosity and creative spark steadilyreturned along with his enthusiasm and his energy for living hestarted to feel more joyful and peaceful and he began to laughagain    although he embraced every moment of his time in this exoticland julian told me that his journey to india was more than asimple vacation to ease an overworked mind he described histime in this faraway land as a personal odyssey of the self heconfided that he was determined to find out who he really was andwhat his life was all about before it was too late to do this his firstpriority was to connect to that cultures vast pool of ancientwisdom on living a more rewarding fulfilling and enlightened life    i dont mean to sound too offthewall john but it was like ihad received a command from within an inner instruction tellingme that i was to begin a spiritual voyage to rekindle the spark thati had lost said julian it was a tremendously liberating time forme    the more he explored the more he heard of indian monkswho had lived beyond the age of a hundred monks who despitetheir advanced years maintained youthful energetic and vitallives the more he travelled the more he learned of ageless yogiswho had mastered the art of mindcontrol and spiritual awakeningand the more he saw the more he longed to understand thedynamics behind these miracles of human nature hoping to applytheir philosophies to his own life     during the early stages of his journey julian sought outmany wellknown and highly respected teachers he told me thateach one of them welcomed him with open arms and open heartssharing whatever gems of knowledge they had absorbed overlifetimes spent in quiet contemplation on the loftier issuessurrounding their existence julian also attempted to describethe beauty of the ancient temples which were strewn across themystical landscape of india edifices which stood as loyal gatekeepers to the wisdom of the ages he said he was moved by thesacredness of these surroundings     it was a very magical time of my life john here i was a tiredold litigator who had sold everything from my racehorse to myrolex and had packed all that remained into a large rucksack thatwould be my constant companion as i ventured into the timelesstraditions of the east     was it hard to leave i wondered aloud unable to contain mycuriosity     actually it was the easiest thing i have ever done the decisionto give up my practice and all my worldly possessions felt naturalalbert camus once said that real generosity toward the futureconsists in giving all to what is present well thats exactly what idid i knew i had to change—so i decided to listen to my heart anddo it in a very dramatic way my life became so much simpler andmeaningful when i left the baggage of my past behind themoment i stopped spending so much time chasing the big pleasuresof life i began to enjoy the little ones like watching the stars dancing in a moonlit sky or soaking in the the sunbeams of a glorioussummer morning and india is such an intellectually stimulatingplace that i rarely thought of all i had left     those initial meetings with the learned and the scholarly ofthat exotic culture though intriguing did not yield the knowledgefor which julian hungered the wisdom that he desired and thepractical techniques that he hoped would change the quality of hislife continued to elude him in those early days of his odyssey itwas not until julian had been in india for about seven months thathe had his first real break    it was while he was in kashmir an ancient and mystical statethat sits sleepily at the foot of the himalayas that he had the goodfortune to meet a gentleman named yogi krishnan this slightman with a cleanshaven head had also been a lawyer in his previous incarnation as he often joked with a toothy grin fed up withwith the hectic pace that personifies modern new delhi he toogave up his material possessions and retreated to a world ofgreater simplicity becoming a caretaker of the village templekrishnan said he had come to know himself and his purpose in thelarger scheme of life     i was tired of living my life like one long air raid drill irealized that my mission is to serve others and somehow tocontribute to making this world a better place now i live togive he told julian i spend my days and nights at this templeliving an austere but fulfilling life i share my realizations withall those who come here to pray i serve those in need i am nota priest i am simply a man who has found his soul     julian informed this lawyer turned yogi of his own story hespoke of his former life of prominence and privilege he told yogikrishnan of his hunger for wealth and his obsession with work herevealed with great emotion his inner turmoil and the crisis ofspirit he had experienced when the once bright light of his lifebegan to flicker in the winds of an outofbalance lifestyle    i too have walked this path my friend i too have felt the painyou have felt yet i have learned that everything happens for areason offered yogi krishnan sympathetically every event hasa purpose and every setback its lesson i have realized that failurewhether of the personal professional or even spiritual kind isessential to personal expansion it brings inner growth and awhole host of psychic rewards never regret your past ratherembrace it as the teacher that it is    after hearing these words julian told me that he felt greatexultation perhaps in yogi krishnan he had found the mentor hewas searching for who better than another former hotshotlawyer who through his own spiritual odyssey had found a betterway of living to teach him the secrets of creating a life of morebalance enchantment and delight     i need your help krishnan i need to learn how to build aricher fuller life     i would be honored to assist you in any way that i canoffered the yogi but may i give you one suggestion     sure     for as long as i have been caring for this temple in this littlevillage i have heard whisperings of a mystical band of sagesliving high in the himalayas legend has it that they have discovered some sort of system that will profoundly improve the qualityof anyones life — and i dont just mean physically it is supposedto be a holistic integrated set of ageless principles and timelesstechniques to liberate the potential of the mind body and soul    julian was fascinated this seemed perfect    just exactly where do these monks live    no one knows and i regret that im too old to start searching but i will tell you one thing my friend many have tried to findthem and many have failed — with tragic consequences thehigher reaches of the himalayas are treacherous beyond compareeven the most skilled climber is rendered helpless against theirnatural ravages but if it is the golden keys to radiant health lasting happiness and inner fulfillment that you are searching for i donot have the wisdom you seek — they do    julian never one to give up easily pressed yogi krishnanagain are you certain that you have no idea where they live    all i can tell you is that the locals in this village know them asthe great sages of sivana in their mythology sivana means oasisof enlightenment these monks are revered as if they are divinein their constitution and influence if i knew where they could befound i would be dutybound to tell you but honestly i do notknow — no one does for that matter    the next morning as the first rays of the indian sun dancedalong the colorful horizon julian set out on his trek to the lostland of sivana at first he thought about hiring a sherpa guide toaid him in his climb through the mountains but for somestrange reason his instincts told him that this was one journeyhe would have to make alone so instead for perhaps the firsttime in his life he shed the shackles of reason and placed histrust in his intuition he felt he would be safe he somehow knewhe would find what he was looking for so with missionary zealhe started to climb    the first few days were easy sometimes he would catch up toone of the cheerful citizens of the village below who happened to bewalking on one of the footpaths perhaps searching for just theright piece of wood for a carving or seeking the sanctuary that thissurreal place offered to all those who dared to venture this highinto the heavens at other times he hiked alone using this time tosilently reflect on where he had been in his life — and where hewas now headed    it didnt take long before the village below was nothing morethan a tiny speck on this marvellous canvas of natural splendorthe majesty of the snowcapped peaks of the himalayas made hisheart beat faster and for one long moment took his breath awayhe felt a oneness with his surroundings a kind of kinship that twoold friends might enjoy after many years spent listening to eachothers innermost thoughts and laughing at each others jokesthe fresh mountain air cleared his mind and energized his spirithaving travelled the world many times over julian had thought hehad seen it all but he had never seen beauty like this thewonders of which he drank at that magical time were an exquisitetribute to the symphony of nature at once he felt joyous exhilarated and carefree it was here high above the humanity belowthat julian slowly ventured out of the cocoon of the ordinary andbegan to explore the realm of the extraordinary    i still remember the words that were going through my mindup there said julian i thought that ultimately life is all aboutchoices ones destiny unfolds according to the choices one makesand i felt certain that the choice i had made was the right one iknew my life would never be the same and that something marvellous maybe even miraculous was about to happen to me it was anamazing awakening    as julian climbed into the rarified regions of the himalayashe told me that he grew anxious but it was those good kind ofjitters like the ones i had on prom night or right before an exciting case began and the media was chasing me up the courtroomsteps and even though i didnt have the benefit of a guide or amap the way was clear and a thin lightly travelled path led mehigher into the deepest reaches of those mountains it was like ihad some sort of inner compass nudging me gently towards mydestination i dont think i could have stopped climbing even if ihad wanted to julian was excited his words spilling out like agushing mountain stream after the rains     as he travelled for two more days along the route that heprayed would take him to sivana julians thoughts wanderedback to his former life though he felt entirely liberated from thestress and strain that personified his former world he did wonderwhether he could really spend the rest of his days without theintellectual challenge that the legal profession had offered himsince he left harvard law school his thoughts then wanderedback to his oakpaneled office in a glittering downtown skyscraperand the idyllic summer home he had sold for a pittance hethought about his old friends with whom he would frequent thefinest of restaurants in the most glamorous locales he alsothought about his prized ferrari and how his heart would soarwhen he gunned the engine and all its ferocity sprang to life witha roar     as he ventured deeper into the depths of this mystical placehis reflections of the past were quickly interrupted by the stunning marvels of the moment it was while he was soaking in thegifts of natures intelligence that something startling happened     from the corner of his eye he saw another figure dressedstrangely in a long flowing red robe topped by a dark blue hoodslightly ahead of him on the path julian was astonished to seeanyone at this isolated spot that had taken him seven treacherousdays to reach as he was many miles away from any real civilization and still uncertain as to where his ultimate destination ofsivana could be found he yelled out to his fellow traveller    the figure refused to respond and accelerated his pace alongthe path they were both climbing not even giving julian the courtesy of a backward glance of acknowledgement soon the mysterious traveller was running his red robe dancing gracefully behindhim like crisp cotton sheets hanging from a clothesline on a windyautumn day    please friend i need your help to find sivana yelled julianive been travelling for seven days with little food and water ithink im lost    the figure came to an abrupt stop julian approachedcautiously while the traveller stood remarkably still and silent hishead did not move his hands did not move and his feet kept theirplace julian could see nothing of the face beneath the hood butwas struck by the contents of the small basket in the hands of thetraveller within the basket was a collection of the most delicateand beautiful flowers julian had ever seen the figure clutched thebasket tighter as julian drew nearer as if to display both a love ofthese prized possessions and a distrust of this tall westernerabout as common to these parts as dew in the desert    julian gazed at the traveller with an intense curiosity a quickburst of a sunbeam revealed that it was a mans face under thelooselyfitting hood but julian had never seen a man quite likethis one though he was at least his own age there were very striking features of this person which left julian mesmerized and causedhim to simply stop and stare for what seemed like an eternity hiseyes were catlike and so penetrating that julian was forced to lookaway his olivecomplexioned skin was supple and smooth hisbody looked strong and powerful and though the mans handsgave away the fact that he was not young he radiated such anabundance of youthfulness and vitality that julian felt hypnotizedby what appeared before him much like a child watching themagician at his first magic show     this must be one of the great sages of sivana julian thoughtto himself scarcely able to contain his delight at his discovery     i am julian mantle ive come to learn from the sages ofsivana do you know where i might find them he asked     the man looked thoughtfully at this weary visitor from thewest his serenity and peace made him appear angelic in natureenlightened in substance     the man spoke softly almost in a whisper why is it that youseek these sages friend     sensing that he had indeed found one of the mystical monkswho had eluded so many before him julian opened his heart andpoured out his odyssey to the traveller he spoke of his former lifeand of the crisis of spirit he had struggled with how he had tradedhis health and his energy for the fleeting rewards that his lawpractice brought him he spoke of how he had traded the riches ofhis soul for a fat bank account and the illusory gratification of hislive fast die young lifestyle and he told him of his travels inmystical india and of his meeting with yogi krishnan the formertrial lawyer from new delhi who had also given up his former lifein the hope of finding inner harmony and lasting peace     the traveller remained silent and still it was not until julianspoke of his burning almost obsessive desire to acquire theancient principles of enlightened living that the man spoke againplacing an arm on julians shoulder the man said gently if youtruly have a heartfelt desire to learn the wisdom of a better waythen it is my duty to help you i am indeed one of those sages thatyou have come so far in search of you are the first person to findus in many years congratulations i admire your tenacity youmust have been quite a lawyer he offered    he paused as if he was a little uncertain of what to do nextand then went on if you like you may come with me as my guestto our temple it rests in a hidden part of this mountain region stillmany hours away from here my brothers and sisters will welcomeyou with open arms we will work together to teach you theancient principles and strategies that our ancestors have passeddown through the ages    before i take you into our private world and share ourcollected knowledge for filling your life with more joy strength andpurpose i must request one promise from you requested thesage upon learning these timeless truths you must return toyour homeland in the west and share this wisdom with all thosewho need to hear it though we are isolated here in these magicalmountains we are aware of the turmoil your world is in goodpeople are losing their way you must give them the hope that theydeserve more importantly you must give them the tools to fulfilltheir dreams this is all i ask    julian instantly accepted the sages terms and promised thathe would carry their precious message to the west as the two menmoved still higher up the mountain path to the lost village of sivanathe indian sun started to set a fiery red circle slipping into a softmagical slumber after a long and weary day julian told me he hasnever forgotten the majesty of that moment walking with anageless indian monk for whom he somehow felt a brotherly lovetravelling to a place he had longed to find with all its wonders andmany mysteries     this was definitely the most memorable moment of my lifehe confided in me julian had always believed that life came downto a few key moments this was one of them deep inside his soulhe somehow sensed that this was the first moment of the rest ofhis life a life soon to be much more than it had ever been                          chapter four         a magical meeting with           the sages of sivanaafter walking for many hours along an intricate series of pathsand grassy trails the two travellers came upon a lusty greenvalley on one side of the valley the snowcapped himalayasoffered their protection like weatherbeaten soldiers guardingthe place where their generals rested on the other a thick forestof pine trees sprouted a perfectly natural tribute to thisenchanting fantasyland     the sage looked at julian and smiled gently welcome to thenirvana of sivana     the two then descended along another lesstravelled way andinto the thick forest which formed the floor of the valley the smellof pine and sandalwood wafted through the cool crisp mountainair julian now barefoot to ease his aching feet felt the damp mossunder his toes he was surprised to see richly colored orchids anda host of other lovely flowers dancing among the trees as ifrejoicing in the beauty and splendor of this tiny slice of heaven     in the distance julian could hear gentle voices soft andsoothing to the ear he continued to follow the sage withoutmaking a sound after walking for about fifteen more minutes thetwo men reached a clearing before him was a sight that even theworldly wise and rarely surprised julian mantle could never haveimagined—a small village made solely out of what appeared to beroses at the center of the village was a tiny temple the kindjulian had seen on his trips to thailand and nepal but this templewas made of red white and pink flowers held together with longstrands of multicolored string and twigs the little huts whichdotted the remaining space appeared to be the austere homes ofthe sages these were also made of roses julian was speechless    as for the monks who inhabited the village those he could seelooked like julians travelling companion who now revealed thathis name was yogi raman he explained that he was the eldestsage of sivana and the leader of this group the citizens of thisdreamlike colony looked astonishingly youthful and moved withpoise and purpose none of them spoke choosing instead torespect the tranquility of this place by performing their tasks insilence    the men who appeared to number only about ten wore thesame redrobed uniform as yogi raman and smiled serenely atjulian as he entered their village each of them looked calmhealthy and deeply contented it was as if the tensions whichplague so many of us in our modern world had sensed that theywere not welcome at this summit of serenity and moved on tomore inviting prospects though it had been many years sincethere had been a new face amongst them these men werecontrolled in their reception offering a simple bow as theirgreeting to this visitor who had travelled so far to find them    the women were equally impressive in their flowing pink silksaris and with white lotuses adorning their jet black hair theymoved busily through the village with exceptional agilityhowever this was not the frantic busyness that pervades the livesof people in our society instead theirs was of the easy gracefulkind with zenlike focus some worked inside the templepreparing for what appeared to be a festival others carriedfirewood and richly embroidered tapestries all were engaged inproductive activity all appeared to be happy    ultimately the faces of the sages of sivana revealed the powerof their way of life even though they were clearly mature adultseach one of them radiated a childlike quality their eyes twinklingwith the vitality of youth none of them had wrinkles none ofthem had gray hair none of them looked old    julian who could scarcely believe what he was experiencingwas offered a feast of fresh fruits and exotic vegetables a diet thathe would later learn was one of the keys to the treasure trove ofideal health enjoyed by the sages after the meal yogi ramanescorted julian to his living quarters a flowerfilled hut containinga small bed with an empty journal pad on it this would be hishome for the foreseeable future    though julian had never seen anything like this magical worldof sivana he somehow felt that this had been a homecoming ofsorts a return to a paradise that he had known long ago somehowthis village of roses was not so foreign to him his intuition told himthat he belonged here if only for a short period this would be theplace where he would rekindle the fire for living that he had knownbefore the legal profession stole his soul a sanctuary where hisbroken spirit would slowly start to heal and so began julians lifeamong the sages of sivana a life of simplicity serenity andharmony the best was soon to come                          chapter five             a spiritual student                 of the sages         great dreamers dreams are never fulfilled they     are always transcended                                      alfred lord whiteheadit was now 800 pm and i still had to prepare for my courtappearance the next day yet i was fascinated by the experience ofthis former legal warrior who had dramatically transformed his lifeafter meeting and studying under these marvellous sages fromindia how amazing i thought and what an extraordinarytransformation i secretly wondered whether the secrets julianhad learned in that far off mountain hideaway could also elevatethe quality of my life and replenish my own sense of wonder for theworld we live in the longer i listened to julian the more i came torealize that my own spirit had become rusty what had happenedto the uncommon passion i brought to everything i did when i wasyounger back then even the simplest of things filled me with asense of joy maybe it was time for me to reinvent my destiny     sensing my fascination with his odyssey and my eagerness tolearn the system of enlightened living that the sages had passed onto him julian quickened the pace as he continued with his tale hetold me how his desire for knowledge coupled with his sharpintellect—refined through many years of battles in the courtroomhad made him a wellloved member of the sivana community as amark of their affection for julian the monks eventually made himan honorary member of their band and treated him like an integralpart of their extended family     eager to expand his knowledge of the workings of the mindbody and soul and to attain selfmastery julian spent literallyevery waking moment under the tutelage of yogi raman the sagebecame more like a father to julian than a teacher though theywere separated in age by only a few years it was clear that thisman had the accumulated wisdom of many lifetimes and mosthappily he was willing to share it with julian     beginning before dawn yogi raman would sit with hisenthusiastic student and fill his mind with insights on the meaningof life and littleknown techniques that he had mastered for livingwith greater vitality creativity and fulfillment he taught julianancient principles which he said anyone could use to live longerstay younger and grow far happier julian also learned how thetwin disciplines of personal mastery and selfresponsibility wouldkeep him from returning to the chaos of crisis that hadcharacterized his life in the west as the weeks slipped intomonths he came to understand the treasuretrove of potentialsleeping within his own mind waiting to be awakened and used forhigher purposes sometimes the teacher and his student wouldsimply sit and watch the blazing indian sun rising from the deepgreen meadows far below sometimes they would rest in quietmeditation savoring the gifts that silence brings sometimes theywould walk through the pine forest discussing points ofphilosophy and enjoying the pleasures of each others company     julian said that the first indications of his personal expansioncame after only three weeks in sivana he started noticing thebeauty in the most ordinary of things whether it was the marvelof a starry night or the enchantment of a spiders web after it hadrained julian absorbed it all he also said that his new lifestyleand the new habits associated with it started to have a profoundeffect on his inner world within a month of applying the principlesand techniques of the sages he told me that he had begun tocultivate the deep sense of peace and inner serenity that hadeluded him in all the years he had lived in the west he becamemore joyful and spontaneous growing more energetic andcreative with each passing day     physical vitality and spiritual strength followed the changes injulians attitude his once overweight frame grew strong and leanwhile the sickly pallor which had characterized his face wasreplaced by a splendid shimmer of health he actually felt as if hecould do anything be anything and unlock the infinite potentialthat he learned was inside every one of us he started to cherishlife and to see the divinity in every aspect of it the ancient systemof this mystical band of monks had started to work its miracles     after pausing as if to express disbelief at his own tale juliangrew philosophical ive realized something very important johnthe world and that includes my inner world is a very specialplace ive also come to see that success on the outside meansnothing unless you also have success within there is a hugedifference between wellbeing and being welloff when i was ahotshot lawyer i used to snicker at all those people who worked atimproving their inner and outer lives get a life i thought but ihave learned that selfmastery and the consistent care of onesmind body and soul are essential to finding ones highest self andliving the life of ones dreams how can you care for others if youcannot even care for yourself how can you do good if you donteven feel good i cant love you if i cannot love myself he offered     suddenly julian grew flustered and slightly uneasy ivenever opened my heart to anyone like this before i apologize forthis john it is just that i experienced such a catharsis up in thosemountains such a spiritual awakening to the powers of theuniverse that i feel others need to know what i know     noticing that it was getting late julian quickly told me hewould take his leave and bid me adieu     you cant leave now julian im really pumped to hear thewisdom you learned in the himalayas and the message youpromised your teachers you would bring back to the west youcant leave me in suspense — you know i cant stand it     ill be back rest assured my friend you know me once istart telling a good story i just cant stop but you have your workto do and i

reply you along with so many others in our society areready for the wisdom i now have the privilege of holding everyone of us should know the philosophy of the sages every one of uscan benefit by it every one of us must know of the perfection thatis their natural state i promise i will share their ancientknowledge with you have patience i will meet you againtomorrow night this time at your house then ill tell you all thatyou need to know to put far more living into your life is that fair    yeah i guess if ive done without it all these years waitinganother twentyfour hours wont kill me i responded withdisappointment    and with that the master litigator turned enlightened yogi ofthe east was gone leaving me with a mind full of unansweredquestions and unfinished thoughts    as i sat in my office quietly i realized how small our worldreally was i thought about the vast pool of knowledge that i hadnot even begun to dip my fingers into i thought about how itmight feel to regain my own zest for living and about the curiosityi had had when i was younger i would love to feel more alive andto bring unbridled energy to my days maybe i too would leave thelegal profession maybe there was a higher calling for me as wellwith these weighty considerations on my mind i turned out thelights locked the door to my office and walked out into the thickheat of another summers night                          chapter six                 the wisdom of                 personal change      i am an artist at living — my work of art is my life                                                     suzukitrue to his word julian showed up at my home the next eveningat about 715 pm i heard four quick knocks on the front door ofmy house a cape cod design with awful pink shutters that mywife believed made our house look like something out ofarchitectural digest julian himself looked strikingly differentthan he had the day before he still embodied radiant health andexuded a wonderful sense of calm it was what he was wearing thatmade me a little uncomfortable    adorning his obviously supple body was a long red robetopped by an ornately embroidered blue hood and though it wasanother sticky night in july the hood covered his head    greetings my friend julian offered enthusiastically    greetings    dont look so alarmed what did you expect me to wear —armani    we both started to laugh softly at first soon our giggles hadturned to guffaws julian certainly had not lost that wicked senseof humor that had kept me entertained so long ago    as we relaxed in my cluttered but comfortable living room icouldnt help but notice the ornate necklace of wooden prayerbeads dangling from his neck    what are those theyre really beautiful    more about these later he said rubbing some of the beadswith his thumb and index finger we have much to talk abouttonight    lets get started i could hardly get anything done at worktoday i was so excited about our meeting    hearing his cue julian immediately started to reveal moreabout his personal transformation and the ease with which itwas effected he told me of the ancient techniques he hadlearned for mind control and for erasing the habit of worrythat was consuming so many in our complex society he spokeof the wisdom that yogi raman and the other monks hadshared for living a more purposeful and rewarding life and hespoke of a series of methods to unleash the wellspring ofyouthfulness and energy he said every one of us hasslumbering deep inside of us    though the conviction with which he spoke was clear i beganto grow skeptical was i the victim of some prank after all thisharvardtrained lawyer was once widely known within the firmfor his practical jokes as well his story was nothing less thanfantastic think about it one of this countrys best known triallawyers throws in the towel sells all his worldly goods and treksoff to india on a spiritual odyssey only to return as a wiseprophet from the himalayas this could not be real     cmon julian stop pulling my leg this whole story isstarting to smack of one of your gags ill bet you rented that robefrom the costume shop across the street from my office isuggested breaking into my best fear grin     julian was quick to respond as if my disbelief was somethinghe had expected in court how do you prove your case     i offer persuasive evidence     right look at the evidence that i have offered you look atmy smooth lineless face look at my physique cant you sensethe abundance of energy i have look at my peacefulness surelyyou can see that i have changed     he had a point this was a man who only a few years ago hadlooked decades older     you didnt go to a plastic surgeon did you     no he smiled they only focus on the outer person ineeded to be healed from within my unbalanced chaotic lifestyleleft me in great distress it was much more than a heart attackthat i suffered it was a rupture of my inner core     but your story its so    mysterious and unusual     julian remained calm and patient in the face of my persistencespotting the pot of tea i had left on the table next to him hestarted to pour into my waiting cup he poured until the cup wasfull—but then he kept on pouring tea started to trickle down thesides of the cup and into the saucer then onto my wifes prizedpersian rug at first i watched silently then i couldnt take it anymore   julian what are you doing my cup is overflowing no matterhow hard you try no more will go in i yelled impatiently   he looked at me for a long moment please dont take this thewrong way i really respect you john i always have howeverjust like this cup you seem to be full of your own ideas and howcan any more go in   until you first empty your cup     i was struck by the truth of his words he was right my manyyears in the conservative legal world doing the same things everyday with the same people who thought the same thoughts everyday had filled my cup to the brim my wife jenny was alwaystelling me that we should be meeting new people and exploringnew things i wish you were just a little more adventurous johnshe would say     i couldnt remember the last time i had read a book that didntdeal with law the profession was my life i began to realize thatthe sterile world i had grown accustomed to had dulled mycreativity and limited my vision     okay i see your point i admitted perhaps all my years asa trial lawyer have made me a hardened skeptic from the minutei saw you in my office yesterday something deep inside me told methat your transformation was genuine and that there was somesort of lesson in it for me maybe i just didnt want to believe it     john tonight is the first night of your new life i simply askthat you think deeply about the wisdom and strategies that i willshare with you and apply them with conviction for a period of onemonth embrace the methods with a deep trust in theireffectiveness there is a reason why they have survived forthousands of years — they work     one month seems like a long time     six hundred and seventytwo hours of inner work toprofoundly improve every waking moment of the rest of your lifeis quite a bargain dont you think investing in yourself is the bestinvestment you will ever make it will not only improve your lifeit will improve the lives of all those around you     hows that     it is only when you have mastered the art of loving yourselfthat you can truly love others its only when you have opened yourown heart that you can touch the hearts of others when you feelcentered and alive you are in a much better position to be a betterperson     what can i expect to happen in those six hundred andseventytwo hours that comprise one month i asked earnestly     you will experience changes within the workings of yourmind body and even your soul that will astonish you you will havemore energy enthusiasm and inner harmony than you have had inperhaps your entire life people will actually begin telling you thatyou look younger and happier a lasting sense of wellbeing andbalance will swiftly return to your life these are just some of thebenefits of the sivanan system     wow     all of what you will hear tonight is designed to improve yourlife not just personally and professionally but spiritually as wellthe advice of the sages is just as current today as it was fivethousand years ago it will not only enrich your inner world it willenhance your outer world and make you far more effective in allthat you do this wisdom is truly the most potent force i have everencountered it is straightforward practical and has been testedin the laboratory of life for centuries most importantly it will workfor anyone but before i share this knowledge with you i must askyou for a promise     i knew there would be strings attached there are no freelunches my loving mother used to say     once you see the power of the strategies and skills shown tome by the sages of sivana and observe the dramatic results theywill bring to your life you must make it your mission to pass thiswisdom on to others who will benefit from this knowledge this isall that i ask of you by agreeing to this you will help me fulfill myown pact with yogi raman     i agreed without reservation julian began to teach me thesystem he had come to consider as sacred while the techniquesthat julian had mastered during his stay were varied at the heartof the sivanan system were seven basic virtues sevenfundamental principles which embodied the keys to selfleadership personal responsibility and spiritual enlightenment     julian told me that yogi raman was the first to share the sevenvirtues with him after a few months in sivana on a clear nightwhen all the others had drifted off into deep slumber ramanknocked softly on the door of julians hut in the voice of a gentleguide he spoke his mind i have observed you closely for manydays now julian i believe that you are a decent man who deeplydesires to fill his life with all that is good since you have arrivedyou have opened yourself up to our traditions and embraced themas your own you have learned a number of our daily habits andhave seen their many salutary effects you have been respectful ofour ways our people have lived this simple peaceful life throughcountless ages and our methods are known to but a few theworld needs to hear our philosophy on enlightened living tonighton the eve of your third month in sivana i will begin to share theinner workings of our system with you not only for your benefitbut for the benefit of all those in your part of the world i will sitwith you daily as i sat with my son when he was a child sadly hepassed on a few years ago his time had come and i do not questionhis exit i enjoyed our time together and cherish the memories inow see you as my son and i feel grateful that all i have learnedover many years of silent contemplation will live on within you     i looked at julian and noticed that his eyes were now shut asif he were transporting himself back to this fairytale land that hadshowered the blessing of knowledge on him     yogi raman told me that the seven virtues for a lifeoverflowing with inner peace joy and a wealth of spiritual giftswere contained within a mystical fable this fable was the essenceof it all he asked me to shut my eyes as i have now done here onthe floor of your living room he then told me to picture thefollowing scene in my minds eye    you are sitting in the middle of a magnificent lush green   garden this garden is filled with the most spectacular   flowers you have ever seen the environment is supremely    tranquil and silent savor the sensual delights of this   garden and feel as if you have all the time in the world to    enjoy this natural oasis as you look around you see that    in the center of this magical garden stands a towering red    lighthouse six stories high suddenly the silence of the   garden is disturbed by a loud creaking as the door at the    base of the lighthouse opens out stumbles a ninefoottall    ninehundredpound japanese sumo wrestler who    casually wanders into the center of the garden    it gets better chuckled julian the japanese sumowrestler is naked well actually he is not totally naked he has apink wire cable covering his private parts   as this sumo wrestler starts to move around the garden   he finds a shiny gold stopwatch which someone had left    behind many years earlier he slips it on and falls to the   ground with an enormous thud the sumo wrestler is   rendered unconscious and lies there silent and still just   when you think he has taken his last breath the wrestler    awakens perhaps stirred by the fragrance of some fresh   yellow roses blooming nearby energized the wrestler   jumps swiftly to his feet and intuitively looks to his left   he is startled at what he sees through the bushes at the   very edge of the garden he observes a long winding path   covered by millions of sparkling diamonds something   seems to instruct the wrestler to take the path and to his   credit he does this path leads him down the road of   everlasting joy and eternal bliss     after hearing this strange tale high atop the himalayasseated next to a monk who had seen the torchlight ofenlightenment firsthand julian told me that he was disappointedquite simply he said that he thought he was going to hearsomething earthshattering knowledge that would stir him toaction perhaps even move him to tears instead all he heard wasa silly story about a sumo wrestler and a lighthouse     yogi raman detected his dismay never overlook the powerof simplicity julian was told     this story may not be the sophisticated discourse that youexpected said the sage but there is a universe of sensibility inits message and a purity in its purpose from the day you arrivedi have thought long and hard as to how i would share ourknowledge with you at first i considered giving you a series oflectures over a period of months but realized that this traditionalapproach was illsuited to the magical nature of the wisdom youare about to receive i then thought of asking all of my brothersand sisters to spend a little time with you every day tutoring youin our philosophy however this too was not the most effective wayfor you to learn what it is we have to tell after great deliberationi finally arrived at what i thought was a very creative yet highlyeffective way to share the entire system of sivana with its sevenvirtues   and that is this mystical fable     the sage added at first it might seem to be frivolous andperhaps even childish but i assure you that every element of thefable embodies a timeless principle for radiant living and has greatdepth of meaning the garden the lighthouse the sumo wrestlerthe pink wire cable the stopwatch the roses and the winding pathof diamonds are symbols of the seven timeless virtues for anenlightened life i can also assure you that if you remember thislittle story and the fundamental truths that it represents you willcarry within you all that you need to know to raise your life to itshighest level you will have all the information and strategies youwill need to profoundly influence the quality of your life and thelives of all those you touch and when you apply this wisdom on adaily basis you will change—mentally emotionally physically andspiritually please write this story deep into your mind and carry itwithin your heart it will only make a dramatic difference if youembrace it without reservation    luckily john said julian i did embrace it carl jung oncesaid that your vision will become clear only when you can look intoyour heart who looks outside dreams who looks insideawakens on that very special night i looked deep into my heartand awakened to the secrets of the ages for enriching the mindcultivating the body and nourishing the soul it is now my turn toshare them with you                          chapter seven  a most extraordinary garden         most people live—whether physically intellectually     or morally—in a very restricted circle of their potential     being we all have reservoirs of life to draw upon of     which we do not dream                                                william jamesin the fable the garden is a symbol for the mind said julian ifyou care for your mind if you nurture it and if you cultivate it justlike a fertile rich garden it will blossom far beyond yourexpectations but if you let the weeds take root lasting peace ofmind and deep inner harmony will always elude you    john let me ask you a simple question if i went into yourbackyard where you have that garden you used to tell me somuch about and threw toxic waste over all your prized petuniasyou wouldnt be thrilled would you    agreed    as a matter of fact most good gardeners guard their gardenslike proud soldiers and make certain that no contamination everenters yet look at the toxic waste that most people put into thefertile garden of their minds every single day the worries andanxieties the fretting about the past the brooding over the futureand those selfcreated fears that wreak havoc within your innerworld in the native language of the sages of sivana which hasexisted for thousands of years the written character for worry isstrikingly similar to the character symbolizing a funeral pyre yogiraman told me that this was no mere coincidence worry drainsthe mind of much of its power and sooner or later it injures thesoul     to live life to the fullest you must stand guard at the gate ofyour garden and let only the very best information enter you trulycannot afford the luxury of a negative thought—not even one themost joyful dynamic and contented people of this world are nodifferent from you or me in terms of their makeup we are all fleshand bones we all come from the same universal source howeverthe ones who do more than just exist the ones who fan the flamesof their human potential and truly savor the magical dance of lifedo different things than those whose lives are ordinary foremostamongst the things that they do is adopt a positive paradigm abouttheir world and all that is in it    julian added the sages taught me that on an average daythe average person runs about sixty thousand thoughts throughhis mind what really amazed me though was that ninetyfivepercent of those thoughts were the same as the ones you thoughtthe day before    are you serious i asked     very this is the tyranny of impoverished thinking thosepeople who think the same thoughts every day most of themnegative have fallen into bad mental habits rather than focusingon all the good in their lives and thinking of ways to make thingseven better they are captives of their pasts some of them worryabout failed relationships or financial problems others fret overtheir lessthanperfect childhoods still others brood over moretrifling matters the way a store clerk might have treated them orthe comment of a coworker that smacked of illwill those whorun their minds in this fashion are allowing worry to rob them oftheir life force they are blocking the enormous potential of theirminds to work magic and deliver into their lives all that they wantemotionally physically and yes even spiritually these peoplenever realize that mind management is the essence of lifemanagement      the way you think stems from habit pure and simplejulian continued with conviction most people just dont realizethe enormous power of their minds i have learned that even thebestconditioned thinkers are using only 1100th of a percent oftheir mental reserves in sivana the sages dared to explore theuntapped potential of their mental capacity on a regular basisand the results were astounding yogi raman through regularand disciplined practice had conditioned his mind so that he wasable to slow down his heartbeat at will he had even trainedhimself to go for weeks without sleep while i would neversuggest that these should be goals for you to aspire to i dosuggest that you start to see your mind for what it is — naturesgreatest gift      are there some exercises i can do to unlock this mind powerbeing able to slow down my heartbeat would definitely make mea hit on the cocktailparty circuit i suggested cheekily      dont worry about that now john ill give you some practicaltechniques that you can try later that will show you the power ofthis ancient technology for now what is important is that youunderstand that mental mastery comes through conditioningnothing more and nothing less most of us have the same rawmaterials from the moment we take our first breath of air whatseparates those people who achieve more than others or those thatare happier than others is the way that they use and refine theseraw materials when you dedicate yourself to transforming yourinner world your life quickly shifts from the ordinary into therealm of the extraordinary    my teacher was growing more excited by the moment hiseyes seemed to twinkle as he spoke of the magic of the mind andthe wealth of goodness it would surely bring    you know john when all is said and done there is only onething that we have absolute dominion over    our kids i said smiling goodnaturedly    no my friend — our minds we might not be able to controlthe weather or the traffic or the moods of all those around us butwe most certainly can control our attitude towards these eventswe all have the power to determine what we will think about in anygiven moment this ability is part of what makes us human yousee one of the fundamental gems of worldly wisdom i havelearned in my travels to the east is also one of the most simple    julian then paused as if to summon up a priceless gift    and what might that be    there is no such thing as objective reality or the real worldthere are no absolutes the face of your greatest enemy mightbe the face of my finest friend an event that appears to be atragedy to one might reveal the seeds of unlimited opportunity toanother what really separates people who are habitually upbeatand optimistic from those who are consistently miserable is howthe circumstances of life are interpreted and processed     julian how could a tragedy be anything but a tragedy     heres a quick example when i was travelling throughcalcutta i met a schoolteacher named malika chand she lovedteaching and treated her students as she would her own childrennurturing their potential with great kindness her perennialmotto was your i can is more important than your iq she wasknown throughout her community as a person who lived to givewho selflessly served anyone in need sadly her beloved schoolwhich had stood as a silent witness to the delightful progress ofgenerations of children succumbed to the flames of a fire set by anarsonist one night all those in the community felt this great lossbut as time passed their anger gave way to apathy and theyresigned themselves to the fact that their children would bewithout a school     what about malika     she was different an eternal optimist if there ever was oneunlike everyone around her she perceived opportunity in whathad happened she told all the parents that every setback offersan equivalent benefit if they took the time to search for it thisevent was a gift in disguise the school that burned to the groundwas old and decrepit the roof leaked and the floor had finallybuckled under the strain of a thousand little feet scamperingacross its surface this was the chance that they had been waitingfor to join hands as a community and build a much better schoolone that would serve many more children in the years to comeand so with this sixtyfouryearold dynamo behind them theymarshalled their collective resources and raised enough funds tobuild a sparkling new school one that stood as a shining exampleof the power of vision in the face of adversity     so its like that old adage about seeing the cup as half fullrather than half empty     thats a fair way to look at it no matter what happens to youin your life you alone have the capacity to choose your response toit when you form the habit of searching for the positive in everycircumstance your life will move into its highest dimensions thisis one of the greatest of all the natural laws     and it all starts with using your mind more effectively     exactly john all success in life whether material orspiritual starts with that twelvepound mass sitting between yourshoulders or more specifically with the thoughts that you put intoyour mind every second of every minute of every day your outerworld reflects the state of your inner world by controlling thethoughts that you think and the way you respond to the events ofyour life you begin to control your destiny     this makes so much sense julian i guess my life has becomeso busy that i have never taken the time to think about thesethings when i was in law school my best friend alex used to lovereading inspirational books he said that they kept him motivatedand energized in the face of our crushing workload i rememberhim telling me that one of them said that the chinese character forcrisis is comprised of two subcharacters one that spells dangerand another that spells opportunity i guess that even the ancientchinese knew that there is a bright side to the darkestcircumstance — if you have the courage to look for it     yogi raman put it this way there are no mistakes in lifeonly lessons there is no such thing as a negative experience onlyopportunities to grow learn and advance along the road of selfmastery from struggle comes strength even pain can be awonderful teacher      pain i protested     absolutely to transcend pain you must first experience it orto put it another way how can you really know the joy of being onthe summit of the mountain unless you have first visited the lowestvalley get my point     to savor the good one must know the bad     yes but i suggest that you stop judging events as eitherpositive or negative rather simply experience them celebratethem and learn from them every event offers you lessons theselittle lessons fuel your inner and outer growth without them youwould be stuck on a plateau just think about it in your own lifemost people have grown the most from their most challengingexperiences and if you meet with an outcome you did not expectand feel a little disappointed remember that the laws of naturealways ensure that when one door closes another opens    julian started to raise his arms in excitement much as asouthern minister might while preaching to his congregationonce you consistently apply this principle to your daily life andstart to condition your mind to translate every event into apositive empowering one you will banish worry forever you willstop being a prisoner of your past instead you will become thearchitect of your future    okay i understand the concept every experience even theworst offers me a lesson therefore i should open my mind to thelearning in every event in this way i will grow stronger andhappier what else might a humble middleclass lawyer do toimprove things    first of all begin to live out of the glory of your imaginationnot your memory    run that one by me again     all im saying is that to liberate the potential of your mindbody and soul you must first expand your imagination you seethings are always created twice first in the workshop of the mindand then and only then in reality i call the process blueprintingbecause anything that you create in your outer world began as asimple blueprint in your inner world on the lush picture screen ofyour mind when you learn to take control of your thoughts andvividly imagine all that you desire from this worldly existence in astate of total expectancy dormant forces will awaken inside youyou will begin to unlock the true potential of your mind to createthe kind of magical life that i believe you deserve from tonightonwards forget about the past dare to dream that you are morethan the sum of your current circumstances expect the best youwill be astonished at the results     you know john all those years in the legal profession ithought i knew so much i spent years studying at the finestschools reading all the law books i could get my hands on andworking with the best role models sure i was a winner at thegame of law yet i how realize i was losing in the game of life i wasso busy chasing the big pleasures of life that i missed out on all thelittle ones i never read those great books my father used to tell meto read i havent built any great friendships ive never learned toappreciate great music having said this i really think i am one ofthe lucky ones my heart attack was my defining moment mypersonal wakeup call if you will believe it or not it gave me asecond chance to live a richer more inspired life like malikachand i saw the seeds of opportunity in my painful experiencemore importantly i had the courage to nourish them    i could see that while julian had grown younger on the outsidehe had grown far wiser within i realized that this evening wasmore than just a fascinating conversation with an old friend irealized that tonight could be ray own defining moment and a clearchance for a new beginning my mind started to consider all thatwas wrong in my own life sure i had a great family and a stablejob as a wellregarded lawyer yet in my quiet moments i knewthere had to be more i had to fill that emptiness that was startingto envelope my life    when i was a kid i dreamed such great dreams often ivisualized myself as a sports hero or as a business tycoon i reallybelieved that i could do have and be whatever i wanted to be ialso remembered the way i used to feel as a young boy growing upon the sunsplashed west coast fun came in the form of simplepleasures fun was spending a glorious afternoon skinnydippingor riding through the woods on my bicycle i had such a curiosityfor life i was an adventurer there were no limits on what myfuture could bring i honestly dont think i have felt that kind offreedom and joy for fifteen years what happened     perhaps i lost sight of my dreams when i became an adult andresigned myself to acting the way adults were supposed to actmaybe i lost sight of them when i went to law school and startedtalking like lawyers were supposed to talk in any event thatevening with julian at my side pouring his heart out over a cup ofcold tea made me resolve to stop spending so much time makinga living and to spend far more time creating a life    looks like i have you thinking about your life also julianobserved start thinking about your dreams for a change justlike when you were a little child jonas salk said it best when hewrote i have had dreams and i have had nightmares i overcamethe nightmares because of my dreams dare to dust off yourdreams john start to revere life again and celebrate all of itswonders awaken yourself to the power of your own mind to makethings happen once you do the universe will conspire with you towork magic in your life     julian then reached into the depths of his robe and pulled out alittle card about the size of a business card which had tears alongits sides apparently the result of many months of constant use     one day while yogi raman and i were walking along a quietmountain path i asked him who his favorite philosopher was hetold me that he had many influences in his life and it was difficultfor him to single out any one source for his inspiration there wasone quotation however that he carried deep within his heart onethat encapsulated all the values he had come to cherish over a lifespent in quiet contemplation at that glorious place deep withinthe middle of nowhere this learned sage of the east shared it withme i too etched its words into my heart they serve as a dailyreminder of all that we are—and all that we can be the wordscame from the great indian philosopher patanjali repeating themaloud every morning before i sit down to meditate has had a veryprofound influence on the course of my day remember johnwords are the verbal embodiment of power    julian then showed me the card the quotation read    when you are inspired by some great purpose some    extraordinary project all of your thoughts break their    bonds your mind transcends limitations your    consciousness expands in every direction and you find    yourself in a new great and wonderful world dormant   forces faculties and talents become alive and you discover    yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed    yourself to be     in that instant i saw the connection between physical vitalityand mental agility julian was in pictureperfect health and lookedmany years younger than he had when we had first met hebrimmed with vibrancy and it appeared that his energy enthusiasmand optimism knew no bounds i could see that he had made manychanges to his former lifestyle but it was obvious that the startingpoint of his magnificent transformation was mental fitness successon the outside indeed begins with success on the inside and bychanging his thoughts julian mantle had changed his life     exactly how can i develop this positive serene and inspiredattitude julian after all these years in my routine i think mymental muscles have grown a little flabby come to think of it ihave very little control over the thoughts that are floating aroundthe garden of my mind i said with sincerity     the mind is a wonderful servant but a terrible master if youhave become a negative thinker this is because you have not caredfor your mind and taken the time to train it to focus on the goodwinston churchill said that the price of greatness isresponsibility over each of your thoughts then you will install thevibrant mindset you are looking for remember the mind truly islike any other muscle in your body use it or lose it     are you saying that if i dont exercise my mind it will growweak     yes look at it this way if you want to strengthen themuscles of your arm to achieve more you must train them if youwant to toughen up your leg muscles you must first exert themsimilarly your mind will do wonderful things for you if only youwill let it it will attract all that you desire into your life once youlearn how to operate it effectively it will create ideal health if youcare for it properly and it will return to its natural state ofpeacefulness and tranquility — if you have the vision to ask for itthe sages of sivana have a very special saying the boundaries ofyour life are merely creations of the self     i dont think i understand that one julian     enlightened thinkers know that their thoughts form theirworld and the quality of ones life comes down to the richness ofones thoughts if you want to live a more peaceful meaningful lifeyou must think more peaceful meaningful thoughts     hit me with the quickfix julian     what do you mean julian asked gently running his bronzedfingers along the front of his brilliantly textured robe     im excited about what you are telling me but im animpatient guy dont you have any exercises or techniques that ican use right now here in my own living room to change the wayi run my mind     quickfixes do not work all lasting inner change requirestime and effort persistence is the mother of personal change imnot saying that it will take years to make profound changes in yourlife if you diligently apply the strategies i am sharing with youevery day for only one month you will be astonished at the resultsyou will begin to tap into the highest levels of your own capacityand enter the realm of the miraculous but to reach thisdestination you must not get hung up on the outcome insteadenjoy the process of personal expansion and growth ironically theless you focus on the end result the quicker it will come     how so     its like that classic story of the young boy who travelled farfrom his home to study under a great teacher when he met thewise old man his first question was how long will it take mebefore i am as wise as you    the response came swiftly five years    this is a very long time the boy replied how about if iwork twice as hard    then it will take ten said the master    ten thats far too long how about if i studied all day andwell into the night every night    fifteen years said the sage    i dont understand replied the boy every time i promise todevote more energy to my goal you tell me that it will take longerwhy    the answer is simple with one eye fixed on the destinationthere is only one left to guide you along the journey    point well taken counselor i conceded graciously soundslike the story of my life     be patient and live with the knowledge that all you aresearching for is certain to come if you prepare for it and expect it    but ive never been the lucky sort julian all that i have everreceived has come through sheer persistence     what is luck my friend julian replied kindly it is nothingmore than the marriage of preparation with opportunity    julian added softly before i give you the precise methodspassed on to me by the sages of sivana i must first share a coupleof key principles first always remember that concentration is atthe root of mental mastery    seriously    i know it surprised me too but it is true the mind canaccomplish extraordinary things you have learned this the veryfact that you have a desire or a dream means that you have thecorresponding capacity to realize it this is one of the greatuniversal truths known to the sages of sivana however toliberate the power of the mind you must first be able to harness itand direct its focus only to the task at hand the moment youconcentrate the focus of your mind on a singular purposeextraordinary gifts will appear within your life    why is it so important to have a concentrated mind    let me offer you a riddle that will answer your questionnicely say you were lost in the woods in the middle of the winteryou desperately needed to stay warm all you have in yourknapsack is a letter your best friend had sent to you a tin of tunaand a small magnifying glass that you carry to compensate foryour fading eyesight luckily you managed to find some drykindling wood but unfortunately you have no matches how wouldyou light the fire    good grief julian had stumped me i had no idea what theanswer was    i give up    its very simple place the letter amongst the dry wood andhold the magnifying glass over it the rays of the sun will befocused so as to ignite the fire within a matter of seconds    and what about the can of tuna    oh i just threw that in to distract you from the obvioussolution julian replied with a smile but the essence of theexample is this putting the letter over the dry wood wouldproduce no result yet the second you use the magnifying glass toconcentrate the scattered rays of the sun onto the letter it willignite this analogy holds true for the mind when youconcentrate its tremendous power on definite meaningfulobjectives you will quickly ignite the flames of your personalpotential and produce startling results     like what i asked     only you can answer this question what is it that you aresearching for do you want to be a better father and live a morebalanced rewarding life do you desire more spiritual fulfillmentis it adventure and fun that you feel you are lacking give it somethought     how about eternal happiness     go big or stay home he chuckled nothing like starting offsmall well you can have that too     how     the sages of sivana have known the secret of happiness forover five thousand years fortunately they were willing to sharethis gift with me do you want to hear it     no i thought id take a break and go wallpaper the garagefirst     huh     of course i want to hear the secret of eternal happinessjulian isnt that what everyone is searching for ultimately     true well here it is    could i trouble you for another cupof tea     cmon quit stalling     alright the secret of happiness is simple find out what youtruly love to do and then direct all of your energy towards doingit if you study the happiest healthiest most satisfied people ofour world you will see that each and every one of them has foundtheir passion in life and then spent their days pursuing it thiscalling is almost always one that in some way serves others onceyou are concentrating your mind power and energy on a pursuitthat you love abundance flows into your life and all your desiresare fulfilled with ease and grace    so simply figure out what turns you on and then do it    if it is a worthy pursuit julian replied    how do you define worthy    as i said john your passion must in some way improve orserve the lives of others victor frankl said it more elegantly thani ever could when he wrote success like happiness cannot bepursued it must ensue and it only does so as the unintended sideeffect of ones personal dedication to a cause greater than oneselfonce you find out what your lifes work is your world will comealive you will wake up every morning with a limitless reservoir ofenergy and enthusiasm all your thoughts will be focused on yourdefinite objective you wont have time to waste time valuablemental power will therefore not be wasted on trifling thoughtsyou will automatically erase the worry habit and become far moreeffective and productive interestingly you will also have a deepsense of inner harmony as if you are somehow being guided torealize your mission it is a wonderful feeling i love it julianoffered gleefully     fascinating and i like the part about getting up feeling goodto be really honest with you julian most days i wish i could juststay under the covers it would be so much better than facing thetraffic the angry clients the aggressive opponents and theceaseless flow of negative influences it all makes me feel so tired     do you know why most people sleep so much     why     because they really dont have anything else to do those whorise with the sun all have one thing in common     insanity     very funny no they all have a purpose that fans the flamesof their inner potential they are driven by their priorities but notin an unhealthy obsessive way it is more effortless and gentlethan that and given their enthusiasm and love for what they aredoing in their lives such people live in the moment their attentionis fully and completely on the task at hand therefore there are noenergy leaks these people are the most vibrant and vitalindividuals you will ever have the good fortune to meet     energy leaks sounds a little new agey julian ill bet youdidnt learn that one at harvard law school     true the sages of sivana pioneered that concept though ithas been around for centuries its application is just as relevanttoday as it was when it was first developed too many of us areconsumed by needless and endless worry this drains us of ournatural vitality and energy have you ever seen the inner tube of abicycle tire     of course     when it is fully inflated it can easily take you to yourdestination but if there are leaks in it the tube eventuallydeflates and your journey comes to an abrupt end this is alsohow the mind works worry causes your precious mental energyand potential to leak just like air leaking out of an inner tubesoon you have no energy left all of your creativity optimism andmotivation has been drained leaving you exhausted     i know the feeling i often spend my days in the chaos ofcrisis i have to be everywhere at once and i cant seem to pleaseanyone on those days i notice that even though i have done verylittle physical labor all my worrying leaves me totally deflated bythe end of the day about the only thing i can do when i get homeis pour myself a scotch and cuddle up with the remote control   exactly too much stress does this to you once you find yourpurpose however life becomes much easier and far morerewarding when you figure out what your main aim or destinyreally is you will never have to work another day in your life    early retirement    no said julian in the nononsense tone he had masteredduring his days as an eminent lawyer your work will be play    wouldnt it be a little risky for me to give up my job to startsearching for my overriding passion and purpose i mean i havea family and real obligations i have four people who depend onme    im not saying you that have to leave the legal professiontomorrow you will however have to start taking risks shake upyour life a bit jet rid of the cobwebs take the road less travelledmost people live within the confines of their comfort zone yogiraman was the first person to explain to me that the best thingyou can do for yourself is regularly move beyond it this is the wayto lasting personal mastery and to realize the true potential ofyour human endowments    and what might those be    your mind your body and your soul    so what risks should i take    stop being so practical start doing the things you havealways wanted to do i have known lawyers who have quit theirjobs to become stage actors and accountants who have become jazzmusicians in the process they have found the deep happiness thathad eluded them for so long so what if they could no longer affordtwo vacations a year and a posh summer home in the caymanscalculated risk taking will pay huge dividends how will you everget to third base with one foot on second    i see your point    so take the time to think discover your real reason for beinghere and then have the courage to act on it     with due respect julian all i do is think as a matter of factpart of my problem is that i think too much my mind never stopsit is filled with mental chatter — it drives me crazy sometimes     what im suggesting is different the sages of sivana alltook time daily to silently contemplate not only where they werebut where they were going they took the time to reflect on theirpurpose and how they were living their lives every day mostimportantly they thought deeply and genuinely about how theywould improve the next day daily incremental improvementsproduce lasting results which in turn lead to positive change     so i should take the time to reflect on my life regularly     yes even ten minutes of focused reflection a day will have aprofound impact on the quality of your life     i understand where you are coming from julian theproblem is once my day gets cranking i cant even find tenminutes to eat lunch     my friend saying that you dont have time to improve yourthoughts and your life is like saying you dont have time to stop forgas because you are too busy driving eventually it will catch upwith you     yeah i know hey you were going to share some techniqueswith me julian i said hoping to learn some practical ways toapply the wisdom i was hearing     there is one technique for mastering the mind which towersabove all the rest it is a favorite of the sages of sivana who taughtit to me with great faith and trust after practicing it for onlytwentyone days i felt more energetic enthusiastic and vibrantthan i had felt in years the practice is over four thousand yearsold it is called the heart of the rose     tell me more     all that you need to perform this exercise is a fresh rose anda silent place natural surroundings are best but a quiet room willalso do nicely start to stare at the center of the rose its heartyogi raman told me that a rose is very much like life you willmeet thorns along the way but if you have faith and believe inyour dreams you will eventually move beyond the thorns into theglory of the flower keep staring at the rose notice its colortexture and design savor its fragrance and think only about thiswonderful object in front of you at first other thoughts will startentering your mind distracting you from the heart of the rosethis is the mark of an untrained mind but you need not worryimprovement will come quickly simply return your attention tothe object of your focus soon your mind will grow strong anddisciplined     thats all there is to it it sounds pretty easy     that is the beauty of it john julian replied however thisritual must be performed daily for it to be effective for the firstfew days you will find it difficult to spend even five minutes in thisexercise most of us live at such a frenetic pace that true stillnessand silence is something foreign and uncomfortable most peoplehearing my words will say that they have no time to sit and stareat a flower these are the same people that will tell you that theyhave no time to enjoy the laughter of children or to walk barefootin the rain these people say they are too busy to do such thingsthey dont even have time to build friendships for friendships alsotake time     you know a lot about such people     i was one of them said julian he then paused and sat stillhis intense gaze riveted on the grandfather clock my grandmotherhad given jenny and i as a housewarming present when i thinkof those who live their lives this way i remember the words of anold british novelist whose work my father loved to read one mustnot allow the clock and the calendar to blind him to the fact thateach moment of life is a miracle — and a mystery     persist and spend longer and longer periods savoring theheart of the rose julian continued in his throaty tone after aweek or two you should be able to perform the technique fortwenty minutes without your mind wandering onto other subjectsthis will be your first indication that you are taking back controlof the fortress of your mind it will then focus only on what youcommand it to focus on it will then be a wonderful servant ableto do extraordinary things for you remember either you controlyour mind or it controls you     practically speaking you will notice that you will feel farcalmer you will have taken a significant step towards erasing theworry habit that plagues most of the population and you will enjoymore energy and optimism most importantly you will alsoobserve a sense of joyfulness entering your life along with anability to appreciate the many gifts that surround you each dayno matter how busy you get and how many challenges you mightface return to the heart of the rose it is your oasis it is yoursilent retreat it is your island of peace never forget that there ispower in silence and stillness stillness is the stepping stone toconnecting with the universal source of intelligence that throbsthrough every living thing     i was fascinated by what i had heard could it really bepossible to profoundly improve the quality of my life with such asimple strategy    there must be more to the dramatic changes i see in youthan the heart of the rose i wondered aloud     yes this is true in fact my transformation came about as aresult of using a number of highly effective strategies in concertdont worry they are all just as simple as the exercise i have justshared with you — and equally as powerful the key for you johnis to open your mind to your potential for living a life rich withpossibilities     julian ever the fountain of knowledge continued to revealwhat he had learned in sivana another particularly goodtechnique for ridding the mind of worry and other negative lifedraining influences is based on what yogi raman called oppositionthinking i learned that under the grand laws of nature the mindcan only hold one thought at any one time try it yourself johnyou will see that it is true     i did try it and it is true     using this littleknown information anyone can easilycreate a positive creative mindset within a short period theprocess is straightforward when an undesirable thoughtoccupies the focal point of your mind immediately replace it witha uplifting one its as if your mind is a giant slide projector withevery thought in your mind being a slide whenever a negativeslide comes up on the screen take swift action to replace it witha positive one     this is where the prayer beads around my neck come injulian added with rising enthusiasm every time i catch myselfthinking a negative thought i take this necklace off and removeanother bead these beads of worry go into a cup i keep in myknapsack together they serve as gentle reminders that i stillhave a distance to travel on the road to mental mastery andresponsibility over the thoughts that fill my mind     hey thats a great one this is really practical stuff i havenever heard anything quite like it tell me more about thisphilosophy of opposition thinking     heres a reallife example lets say you have had a toughday in court the judge disagreed with your interpretation of thelaw the litigator on the other side belonged in a cage and yourclient was more than a little annoyed with your performance youcome home and fall into your favorite chair full of gloom step oneis to become aware that you are thinking these uninspiringthoughts selfknowledge is the stepping stone to selfmasterystep two is to appreciate once and for all that just as easily as youallowed those gloomy thoughts to enter you can replace them withcheerful ones so think of the opposite of gloom concentrate onbeing cheerful and energetic feel that you are happy perhaps youmight even start to smile move your body as you do when you arejoyful and full of enthusiasm sit up straight breathe deeply andtrain the power of your mind on positive thoughts you will noticea remarkable difference in the way you feel within minutes evenmore importantly if you keep up your practice of oppositionthinking applying it to every negative thought that habituallyvisits your mind within weeks you will see that they no longer holdany power do you see what im getting at    julian continued his explanation thoughts are vital livingthings little bundles of energy if you will most people dont giveany thought to the nature of their thoughts and yet the quality ofyour thinking determines the quality of your life thoughts arejust as much a part of the material world as the lake you swim inor the street you walk on weak minds lead to weak actions astrong disciplined mind which anyone can cultivate through dailypractice can achieve miracles if you want to live life to the fullestcare for your thoughts as you would your most prized possessionswork hard to remove all inner turbulence the rewards will beabundant     i never saw thoughts as living things julian i repliedamazed at this discovery but i can see how they influence everyelement of my world     the sages of sivana firmly believed that one should onlythink sattvic or pure thoughts they arrived at such a statethrough the techniques i have just shared with you along withother practices such as a natural diet the repetition of positiveaffirmations or mantras as they called them reading books richwith wisdom and by constantly ensuring that their company wasenlightened if even one impure thought entered the temple oftheir minds they would punish themselves by travelling manymiles to an imposing waterfall and standing under the icecoldwater until they could no longer bear the frigid temperature     i thought you told me these sages were wise standing underan icecold waterfall deep in the himalayan mountains for thinkingone little negative thought strikes me as extreme behavior     julian was lightning fast in his response the result of his manyyears as a worldclass legal warrior john ill be blunt you trulycannot afford the luxury of even one negative thought     really     really a worrisome thought is like an embryo it starts offsmall but grows and grows soon it takes on a life of its own     julian stopped for a moment and then smiled sorry if i seema little evangelistic when i speak on this subject on the philosophyi learned on my journey its just that i have discovered tools thatcan improve the lives of many people people who feel unfulfilleduninspired and unhappy a few adjustments in their daily routinesto include the heart of the rose technique and a constantapplication of opposition thinking will give them the lives theywant i think they deserve to know this     before i move from the garden to the next element of yogiramans mystical fable i must let you know of one more secretwhich will offer you great aid in your personal growth this secretis based on the ancient principle that everything is always createdtwice first in the mind and then in reality i have shared alreadythat thoughts are things material messengers that we send out toinfluence our physical world i have also informed you that if youhope to make remarkable improvements in your outer world youmust first start within and change the caliber of your thoughts    the sages of sivana had a wonderful way to ensure that theirthoughts were pure and wholesome this technique was alsohighly effective in manifesting their desires however simple intoreality the method will work for anyone it will work for a younglawyer who seeks financial abundance just as it will work for amother seeking a richer family life or a salesperson seeking toclose more sales the technique was known to the sages as thesecret of the lake to apply it these teachers would rise at 400am as they felt that the early morning possessed magicalqualities from which they could benefit the sages would thentravel along a series of steep and narrow mountain paths whicheventually led them to the lower reaches of the region theyinhabited once there they would walk along a barely visible traillined with magnificent pine trees and exotic flowers until theyarrived at a clearing at the edge of the clearing was an aqua bluelake covered by thousands of tiny white lotuses the water of thelake was strikingly still and calm it was truly a miraculous sightthe sages told me that this lake had been a friend to theirancestors over the ages    what was the secret of the lake i asked impatiently    julian explained that the sages would look into the waters ofthe still lake and envision their dreams becoming reality if it wasthe virtue of discipline they wished to cultivate within their livesthey would picture themselves getting up at dawn performingtheir rigorous physical regimen without fail and spending days insilence to enhance their willpower if it was more joy they wereseeking they would look into the lake and envision themselveslaughing uncontrollably or smiling each time they met one of theirbrothers or sisters if it was courage they desired they wouldpicture themselves acting with strength in the moment of crisisand challenge    yogi raman once told me that as a boy he lacked confidenceas he was smaller than the other boys his age while they werekind and gentle to him given their environmental influences hegrew insecure and shy to cure this weakness yogi raman wouldtravel to this heavenly spot and use the lake as a picture screen forimages of the person he hoped to be some days he would visualizehimself as a strong leader standing tall and speaking with apowerful commanding voice other days he would see himself ashe wished to be when he grew older a wise sage filled withtremendous inner strength and character all the virtues hewished to have in his life he saw first on the surface of the lake     within a matter of months yogi raman became the personwhom he mentally saw himself becoming you see john the mindworks through pictures pictures affect your selfimage and yourselfimage affects the way you feel act and achieve if your selfimage tells you that you are too young to be a successful lawyer ortoo old to change your habits for the better you never will achievethese goals if your selfimage tells you that lives rich withpurpose excellent health and happiness are only for people frombackgrounds other than your own this prophecy will ultimatelybecome your reality    but when you run inspiring imaginative pictures through themovie screen of your mind wonderful things start to happen inyour life einstein said that imagination is more important thanknowledge you must spend some time every day even if it is justa few minutes in the practice of creative envisioning see yourselfas you want to be whether this means serving as a great judge agreat father or a great citizen of your community    do i have to find a special lake to apply the secret of thelake i asked innocently    no the secret of the lake was simply the sages name forthe ageless technique of using positive images to influence themind you can practice this method in your own living room oreven at the office if you really want to shut your door hold all callsand close your eyes then take a few deep breaths you will noticethat after two or three minutes you will start to feel relaxed nextvisualize mental pictures of all that you want to be to have and toattain in your life if you want to be the worlds best fatherenvision yourself laughing and playing with your kids respondingto their questions with an open heart picture yourself actinggracefully and lovingly in a tense situation mentally rehearse theway you will govern your actions when a similar scene unfolds onthe canvas of reality    the magic of visualization can be applied to so manysituations you can use it to be more effective in court to enhanceyour relationships and to develop yourself spiritually consistentuse of this method will also bring you financial rewards along withan abundance of material gain if this is important to youunderstand once and for all that your mind has magnetic power toattract all that you desire into your life if there is a lack in yourlife it is because there is a lack in your thoughts hold wonderfulpictures in your minds eye even one negative image is poisonousto your mindset once you start to experience the joy this ancienttechnique brings you will realize the infinite potential of yourmind and begin to liberate the storehouse of ability and energythat currently sleeps within you     it was as if julian was speaking a foreign tongue i had neverheard anyone speak of the magnetic power of the mind to attractspiritual and material abundance nor had i ever heard anyonespeak of the power of imaging and its profound effects on everyaspect of ones world yet deep inside i had faith in what julianwas saying this was a man whose judgment and intellectualabilities were impeccable this was a man who was internationallyrespected for his legal acumen this was a man who had walkeddown the path i was now journeying along julian had foundsomething on his odyssey to the east that much was clearlooking at his physical vitality his obvious tranquility seeing histransformation confirmed that i would be wise to listen to hisadvice     the more i thought about what i was hearing the more senseit made surely the mind must have a great deal more potentialthan most of us are currently using how else could mothers liftotherwise immovable cars to save their crying infants who hadfallen underneath how else could martial artists break stacks ofbricks with one fell swoop of their hands how else could the yogisof the east slow down their heartbeats at will or enduretremendous pain without blinking an eye maybe the real problemwas within me and my lack of belief in the gifts that every beingpossesses perhaps this evening sitting alongside a formermillionairelawyer turned monk of the himalayas was a sort ofwakeup call for me to start making the most of my life     but doing these exercises at the office julian i respondedmy partners think im strange enough as it is      yogi raman and all the kind sages with whom he lived oftenused a saying that had been passed down to them through thegenerations it is my privilege to pass it on to you on what hasbecome an important evening for both of us if i may say so thewords are as follows there is nothing noble about being superiorto some other person true nobility lies in being superior to yourformer self all im really getting at is that if you want to improveyour life and live with all that you deserve you must run your ownrace it doesnt matter what other people say about you what isimportant is what you say to yourself do not be concerned withthe judgment of others as long as you know what you are doing isright you can do whatever you want to do as long as it is correctaccording to your conscience and your heart never be ashamed ofdoing that which is right decide on what you think is good andthen stick to it and for gods sake never get into the petty habitof measuring your selfworth against other peoples net worth asyogi raman preached every second you spend thinking aboutsomeone elses dreams you take time away from your own     it was now seven minutes past midnight remarkably i didntfeel the least bit tired when i shared this with julian he smiledonce again you have learned yet another principle forenlightened living for the most part fatigue is a creation of themind fatigue dominates the lives of those who are living withoutdirection and dreams let me give you an example have you everhad an afternoon at the office where you were reading your drycase reports and your mind started to wander and you started tofeel sleepy     from time to time i answered not wishing to reveal the factthat this was my modus operandi sure most of us feel drowsy atwork on a regular basis     yet if a friend calls on the phone to ask you if you want to goout to the ball game that night or asks you for advice on his golfgame i have no doubt that you would spring to life every trace ofyour fatigue would vanish is that a fair assessment     thats fair counselor     julian knew he was on a roll so your tiredness was nothingmore then a mental creation a bad habit your mind has cultivatedto act as a crutch when you are performing a tedious task tonightyou are obviously enchanted with my story and keen to learn thewisdom that has been revealed to me your interest and mentalfocus give you energy this evening your mind has not been in thepast nor has it been in the future it has been squarely focused onthe present on our conversation when you consistently directyour mind to live in the present you will always have boundlessenergy no matter what time the clock reflects     i nodded my head in agreement julians wisdom seemed soobvious and yet so much of it had never occurred to me i guesscommon sense is not always so common i thought about what myfather used to tell me when i was growing up only those whoseek shall find i wished he was with mechapter 7 action summary • julians wisdom in a nutshell  t he s y m b ol  t he v i r t u e         master your mind                           •   cultivate your mind  it will

      foster c mcclellanthe day that yogi raman shared his mystical little fable with mehigh atop the himalayas was actually quite similar to this day inmany respects said julian    really    our meeting began in the evening and carried on well into thenight there was such a chemistry between the two of us that theair seemed to crackle with electricity as i mentioned to youearlier from the first moment i met raman i felt as if he was thebrother i never had tonight sitting here with you and enjoyingthe look of intrigue on your face i feel the same energy and bondi will also tell you that i have always thought of you as my littlebrother since we became friends ill tell you the truth i saw a lotof myself in you     you were an amazing litigator julian i will never forget youreffectiveness     it was obvious that he had no interest in exploring themuseum of his past     john id like to continue to share the elements of yogiramans fable with you but before i do this i must confirmsomething already you have learned a number of highlyeffective strategies for personal change which will do wondersfor you if you apply them consistently i will open my heart to youtonight and reveal everything i know as it is my duty to do i justwant to make sure that you fully understand how important it isthat you in turn pass this wisdom on to all those who aresearching for such guidance we are living in a very troubledworld negativity pervades it and many in our society arefloating like ships without rudders weary souls searching for alighthouse that will keep them from crashing against the rockyshores you must serve as a captain of sorts im placing my trustin you to take the message of the sages of sivana to all those whoneed it    after consideration i promised julian with conviction that iwould accept this assignment he then continued passionatelythe beauty of the whole exercise is that as you strive to improvethe lives of others your own life will be elevated into its highestdimensions this truth is based on an ancient paradigm forextraordinary living     im all ears     basically the sages of the himalayas guided their lives by asimple rule he who serves the most reaps the most emotionallyphysically mentally and spiritually this is the way to inner peaceand outer fulfillment    i once read that people who study others are wise but thosewho study themselves are enlightened here perhaps for the firsttime i saw a man who truly knew himself perhaps his highest selfin his austere clothing with the halfsmile of a youthful buddhagracing his supple face julian mantle appeared to have it all idealhealth happiness and an overriding sense of his role in thekaleidoscope of the universe yet he owned nothing     this brings me to the lighthouse said julian remainingfocused on the task at hand     i was wondering how that fit into yogi ramans fable     ill try to explain he responded sounding more like a wellschooled professor than a lawyer turned monk who had renouncedthe sensual world you have now learned that the mind is like afertile garden and for it to flourish you must nurture it dailynever let the weeds of impure thought and action take the gardenof your mind stand guard at the gateway of your mind keep ithealthy and strong — it will work miracles in your life if you willonly let it     you will recall that in the middle of the garden stood amagnificent lighthouse this symbol will remind you of yet anotherancient principle for enlightened living the purpose of life is a lifeof purpose those who are truly enlightened know what they wantout of life emotionally materially physically and spirituallyclearly defined priorities and goals for every aspect of your lifewill serve a role similar to that played by a lighthouse offering youguidance and refuge when the seas become rough you see johnanyone can revolutionize their lives once they revolutionize thedirection in which they are moving but if you dont even knowwhere you are going how will you ever know when you get there    julian transported me back to the time when yogi ramanexamined this principle with him he recalled the sages exactwords life is funny observed yogi raman one would thinkthat the less one worked the more one would have the chance toexperience happiness however the real source of happiness canbe stated in a word achievement lasting happiness comes fromsteadily working to accomplish your goals and advancingconfidently in the direction of your lifes purpose this is the secretto kindling the inner fire that lurks within you i do understandthat it might seem more than a little ironic that you have travelledthousands of miles from your achievementoriented society tospeak to a cluster of mystical sages living high in the himalayasonly to learn that another eternal secret of happiness can be foundin achievement but it is true    workaholic monks i suggested playfully    quite the opposite while the sages were tremendouslyproductive people their productivity was not of the frenetic typeinstead it was of the peaceful focused zenlike kind    how so    everything they did had a purpose though they wereremoved from the modern world and lived a highly spiritualexistence they were also highly effective some spent their dayspolishing off philosophical treatises others created fabulousrichly textured poems which challenged their intellect andrenewed their creativity still others passed their time in thesilence of total contemplation looking like illuminated statuesseated in the ancient lotus pose the sages of sivana did not wastetime their collective conscience told them that their lives had apurpose and they had a duty to fulfill     this is what yogi raman said to me here in sivana wheretime appears to stand still you might wonder what a group ofsimple possessionless sages would ever need or hope to achievebut achievement need not be of the material sort personally myobjectives are to attain peace of mind selfmastery andenlightenment if i fail to accomplish these goals by the end of mylife i am certain that i will die feeling unfulfilled and dissatisfied     julian told me that that was the first time he had heard any ofhis teachers in sivana speak of their own mortality and yogiraman sensed this in my expression you need not worry myfriend i have already lived past the age of one hundred and haveno plans for a quick exit my point is simply that when you clearlyknow what aims you wish to achieve over the course of your life bethey material emotional physical or spiritual and you spend yourdays accomplishing them you will ultimately find eternal joy yourlife will be as delightful as mine — and you will come to know asplendid reality but you must know your lifes aim and thenmanifest this vision into reality by consistent action we sages callthis dharma which is the sanskrit word for lifes purpose     lifelong contentment will come from the fulfillment of mydharma i asked     most certainly from dharma springs inner harmony andlasting satisfaction dharma is based upon the ancient principle thatsays every one of us has a heroic mission whilst we walk this earthwe have all been granted a unique set of gifts and talents that willreadily allow us to realize this lifework the key is to discover themand in doing so discover the main objective of your life     i interrupted julian its sort of what you were saying earlierabout risk taking     maybe yes maybe no     i dont follow     yes it may seem as though you are forced to take a few risksto discover what you are best at and the essence of your lifespurpose many people quit jobs that have stifled their progressthe moment they discover the true purpose of their existencethere is always the apparent risk that comes with selfexamination and soul searching but no because there is never arisk in discovering yourself and the mission of your life selfknowledge is the dna of selfenlightenment it is a very goodindeed essential thing    what is your dharma julian i asked casually attemptingto mask my burning curiosity    mine is simple to selflessly serve others remember you willnot find true joy in sleeping in relaxing or in spending your timelike an idler as benjamin disraeli said the secret of success isconstancy of purpose the happiness you are searching for comesthrough reflecting on the worthy aims you are dedicated toachieving and then taking action daily to advance them this is adirect application of the timeless philosophy which prescribes thatthose things which are most important should never be sacrificedto those things which are the least important the lighthouse inyogi ramans fable will always remind you of the power of settingclearly defined purposeful goals and most importantly of havingthe character power to act on them    over the course of the next few hours i learned from julianthat all highly developed fully actualized people understand theimportance of exploring their talents uncovering their personalpurpose and then applying their human gifts in the direction ofthis calling some people selflessly serve humanity as physiciansothers as artists some people discover that they are powerfulcommunicators and become wonderful teachers whilst otherscome to realize that their legacy will be in the form of innovationsin the field of business or science the key is to have the disciplineand vision to see your heroic mission and to ensure that it servesother people while you realize it     is this a form of goalsetting    goalsetting is the starting point mapping out yourobjectives and your goals releases the creative juices which getyou on to the path of your purpose believe it or not yogi ramanand the other sages were very hot on goals     youre kidding highly effective monks living deep in thehimalayan mountains who meditate all night and set goals all dayi love it     john always judge by results look at me sometimes i donteven recognize myself when i look in the mirror my onceunfulfilling existence has been replaced by one rich with adventuremystery and excitement i am young again and enjoy vibrant healthi am truly happy the wisdom i am sharing with you is so potent andso important and so lifegiving that you simply must stay open to it     i am julian i really am everything you have said makesperfect sense although some of the techniques do sound a littleodd but i have promised to try them and i will i agree that thisinformation is powerful     if i have seen farther than others it is simply because i havestood on the shoulders of great teachers replied julian withhumility heres another example yogi raman was an expertarcher a true master to illustrate his philosophy on theimportance of setting clearly defined objectives in every aspect ofones life and fulfilling ones mission he offered a demonstration iwill never forget    near where we were sitting there was a magnificent oak treethe sage pulled one of the roses from the garland he habituallywore and placed it on the center of the trunk he then pulled threeobjects from the large knapsack that was his constant companionwhenever he ventured to distant mountain climes such as the onewe were visiting the first object was his favorite bow made of awonderfully fragrant yet sturdy sandalwood the second item wasan arrow the third object was a lilywhite handkerchief — thekind i used to wear in the pocket of my expensive suits to impressjudges and juries julian added apologetically    yogi raman then asked julian to put the handkerchief over hiseyes as a blindfold    how far away from the rose am i yogi raman asked hispupil    one hundred feet julian guessed    have you ever observed me in my daily practice of thisancient sport of archery the sage queried in full knowledge ofthe response that would come    i have seen you strike the bullseye from a mark almostthree hundred feet away and i cannot recall a time that you haveever missed at your current distance julian noted dutifully    then with his eyes covered by the cloth and his feet placedsecurely in the earth the teacher drew the bow with all his energyand released the arrow — aiming directly at the rose hangingfrom the tree the arrow struck the large oak with a thud missingits mark by an embarrassingly large distance    i thought you were going to display more of your magicalabilities yogi raman what happened    we have travelled to this isolated place for one reason only ihave agreed to reveal all my worldly wisdom to you todaysdemonstration is meant to reinforce my advice on the importanceof setting clearly defined objectives in your life and knowingprecisely where you are going what you just saw confirms themost important principle for anyone seeking to attain their goalsand to fulfill their lifes purpose you will never be able to hit atarget that you cannot see people spend their whole livesdreaming of becoming happier living with more vitality and havingan abundance of passion yet they do not see the importance oftaking even ten minutes a month to write out their goals and tothink deeply about the meaning of their lives their dharma goalsetting will make your life magnificent your world will becomericher more delightful and more magical    you see julian our ancestors have taught us that settingclearly defined objectives for what we desire in our mentalphysical and spiritual world is critical to their realization in theworld you came from people set financial and material goalsthere is nothing wrong with this if this is what you valuehowever to attain selfmastery and inner enlightenment youmust set concrete objectives in other areas as well would itsurprise you to know that i have clearly defined objectives withrespect to the peace of mind i desire the energy i bring to eachday and the love that i offer to all those around me goalsettingis not just for distinguished lawyers such as yourself who reside ina world full of material attractions anyone who wishes to improvethe quality of their inner as well as their outer worlds would dowell to take out a piece of paper and start writing out their lifeaims at the very moment that this is done natural forces willcome into play which start to transform these dreams into reality    what i was hearing fascinated me when i was a footballplayer in high school my coach had constantly spoken of theimportance of knowing what we wanted from every game knowyour outcome was his personal creed and our team wouldntdream of stepping onto the playing field without a clear game planthat would lead us to victory i wondered why as i had grownolder i had never taken the time to develop a game plan for myown life maybe julian and yogi raman had something here     what is so special about taking out a sheet of paper andwriting out your goals how could such a simple act make such adifference i asked     julian was delighted your obvious interest inspires me johnenthusiasm is one of the key ingredients for a lifetime of successfulliving and i am glad to see that you still have every ounce of yoursearlier i taught you that we each think about 60000 thoughts onan average day by writing out your desires and goals on a piece ofpaper you send a red flag to your subconscious mind that thesethoughts are far more important than the remaining 59999 otherones your mind will then start to seek out all opportunities torealize your destiny like a guided missile it is really a veryscientific process most of us are simply not aware of it     a few of my partners are big on goalsetting come to thinkof it they are the most financially successful people i know but idont think they are the most balanced i observed     perhaps they are not setting the right goals you see johnlife pretty much gives you what you ask from it most people wantto feel better have more energy or live with greater satisfactionyet when you ask them to tell you precisely what it is they wantthey have no answer you change your life the moment you setyour goals and start to seek out your dharma julian said hiseyes sparkling with the truth of his words    have you ever met someone with a strange name and thenstarted to notice that name appearing everywhere in newspaperson the television or at the office or have you ever becomeinterested in a new subject lets say fly fishing and then noticedthat you couldnt go anywhere without hearing about the wondersof fly fishing this is but one illustration of the ageless principleyogi raman called joriki which i have since learned meansconcentrated mind concentrate every ounce of your mentalenergy on selfdiscovery learn what you excel at and what makesyou happy maybe you are practicing law but are really meant tobe a school teacher given your patience and love of teachingperhaps you are a frustrated painter or sculptor whatever it isfind your passion and then follow it     now that i really think about it it would be sad to reach theend of my life without realizing that i had some special genius thatwould have unlocked my potential and helped others — even in asmall way     thats right so from this moment onwards be acutely awareof your aim in life awaken your mind to the abundance ofpossibility around you start to live with more zest the humanmind is the worlds largest filtering device when used properly itfilters out what you perceive as unimportant and gives you onlythe information you are looking for at that time at this verymoment as we sit here in your living room there are hundreds ifnot thousands of things going on that we are not paying anyattention to there is the sound of the lovers giggling as they strollalong the boardwalk the goldfish in the tank behind you the coolair being blown from the air conditioner and even the beat of myown heart the moment i decide to concentrate on my heartbeati start to notice its rhythm and its qualities similarly when youdecide to start concentrating your mind on your lifes main aimsyour mind starts to filter out the unimportant and focus only onthe important    to tell you the truth i think its about time i discovered mypurpose i said dont get me wrong there are a lot of greatthings in my life but it isnt as rewarding as i think it could be ifi left this world today i really cant say for sure that ive madethat big a difference     how does that make you feel     depressed i offered with total honesty i know i havetalent actually i was one heck of a good artist when i wasyounger that was until the legal profession beckoned with thepromise of a more stable life     do you ever wish you had made painting your profession     i really havent given it much thought but i will say onething when i painted i was in heaven     it really fired you up didnt it     absolutely i lost track of time when i was in the studiopainting i would get lost in the canvas it was a real release forme it was almost as if i transcended time and moved into anotherdimension     john this is the power of concentrating your mind on apursuit that you love goethe said that we are shaped andfashioned by what we love maybe your dharma is to brighten theworld with lovely scenes at least start spending a little timepainting every day     how about applying this philosophy to things less esotericthan changing my life i asked with a grin     this should be good julian replied like what     lets say one of my aims although a minor one was to drop the spare tire i am carrying around my waist where would i start    dont be embarrassed you master the art of goalsetting —and goal getting — by starting off small    the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step iasked intuitively    precisely and getting good at accomplishing little featsprepares you for realizing the big ones so to answer your questionsquarely there is nothing wrong with mapping out a full range ofsmaller goals in the process of planning your bigger ones    julian told me that the sages of sivana had created a fivestepmethod to reach their objectives and fulfill the purposes of theirlives it was simple practical and it worked the first step was toform a clear mental image of the outcome if this was to loseweight julian told me that every morning just after i woke up iwas to envision myself as a lean fit person full of vitality andboundless energy the clearer this mental picture the moreeffective the process would be he said that the mind was theultimate treasure house of power and this simple act of picturingmy goal would open the gateway to the actualization of this desirestep two was to get some positive pressure on myself    the main reason people do not follow through on anyresolutions they make is that it is too easy to slip back into theirold ways pressure is not always a bad thing pressure can inspireyou to achieve great ends people generally achieve magnificentthings when their backs are up against the wall and they areforced to tap into the wellspring of human potential that lieswithin them    how can i create this positive pressure on myself i askednow thinking about the possibilities of applying this method toeverything from getting up earlier to being a more patient andloving father    there are a whole host of ways to do this one of the best isthe public pledge tell everyone you know that you will lose theexcess weight or write that novel or whatever your goal might beonce you make your goal known to the world there will instantlybe pressure on you to work towards its fulfillment since no onelikes to look like a failure in sivana my teachers used moredramatic means to create this positive pressure i speak of theywould declare to one another that if they did not follow through ontheir commitments such as fasting for a week or getting up dailyat 400 am to meditate they would go down to the icy waterfalland stand under it until their arms and legs went numb this is anextreme illustration of the power that pressure can exert on thebuilding of good habits and the attainment of goals     extreme might be an understatement julian what abizarre ritual     extremely effective though the point is simply that whenyou train your mind to associate pleasure with good habits andpunishment with bad ones your weaknesses will quickly fall bythe wayside     you said there were five steps to follow to make my desirescome true i said impatiently what are the remaining three      yes john step one is to have a clear vision of your outcomestep two is to create positive pressure to keep you inspired thethird step is a simple one never set a goal without attaching atimeline to it to breathe life into a goal you must attach a precisedeadline to it its just like when you are preparing cases for courtyou always focus your attention on the ones the judge hasscheduled to be heard tomorrow rather than on the ones withoutany court date     oh and by the way explained julian remember that a goalthat is not committed to paper is no goal at all go out and buy ajournal — a cheap coil notepad will do call this your dream bookand fill it with all your desires objectives and dreams get to knowyourself and what you are all about     dont i already know myself     most people dont they have never taken the time to knowtheir strengths their weaknesses their hopes their dreams thechinese define image in these terms there are three mirrors thatform a persons reflection the first is how you see yourself thesecond is how others see you and the third mirror reflects thetruth know yourself john know the truth     divide your dream book into separate sections for goalsrelating to the different areas of your life for example you mighthave sections for your physical fitness goals your financial goalsyour personal empowerment goals your relationship and socialgoals and perhaps most importantly your spiritual goals     hey that sounds like fun ive never thought about doing something as creative as that for myself i really should startchallenging myself more i said     i agree another particularly effective technique i learned isto fill your dream book with pictures of the things you desire andimages of people who have cultivated the abilities talents and qualities that you hope to emulate getting back to you and your spare tire if you want to lose weight and be in outstanding physical shape paste a picture of a marathon runner or an elite athlete in your dream book if you want to be the worlds finest husband why not clip out a picture of someone who represents this— perhaps your father — and put it into your journal in the relationship section if you are dreaming of a mansion by the sea or a sports car find an inspiring picture of these objects and usethem for your book of dreams then review this book daily evenfor a few minutes make it your friend the results will startle you      this is pretty revolutionary stuff julian i mean though theseideas have been around for centuries everybody i know todaycould improve the quality of their daily lives by applying even a fewof them my wife would love to have a dream book shed probablyfill it with pictures of me without my notorious belly      its really not that big julian suggested in a consoling tone      then why does jenny call me mr donut i said breakinginto a broad smile      julian started to laugh i had to follow soon the two of us werehowling on the floor      i guess if you cant laugh at yourself who can you laugh ati said still giggling      very true my friend when i was chained to my formerlifestyle one of my main problems was that i took life tooseriously now i am much more playful and childlike i enjoy all oflifes gifts no matter how small they are      but i have digressed i have so much to tell you and it is allflowing out of me at once      back to the fivestep method to attain your aims and realizeyour goals once you have formed a clear mental picture of youroutcome created a little pressure behind it set a deadline andcommitted it to paper the next step is to apply what yogi ramancalled the magic rule of 21 the learned men and women of hisworld believed that for new behavior to crystallize into a habitone had to perform the new activity for twentyone days in a row       whats so special about twentyone days       the sages were absolute masters of creating new morerewarding habits which governed the conduct of their lives yogiraman once told me that a bad habit once acquired could never beerased     but all evening you have been inspiring me to change the wayi live my life how can i possibly do this if i can never erase any ofmy bad habits     i said that bad habits can never be erased i did not say thatnegative habits could not be replaced julian noted with precision     oh julian you always were the king of semantics but ithink i see your point     the only way to permanently install a new habit is to direct somuch energy toward it that the old one slips away like anunwelcome house guest the installation is generally complete inabout twentyone days the time it takes to create a new neuralpathway     say i wanted to start practicing the heart of the rosetechnique to erase the worry habit and live at a more peacefulpace do i have to do it at the same time every day     good question the first thing i will tell you is that you neverhave to do anything everything i am sharing with you tonight iam offering as a friend who is genuinely interested in your growthand development every strategy tool and technique has beentested over time for effectiveness and measurable results this iassure you and though my heart tells me that i should imploreyou to try all of the methods of the sages my conscience tells meto simply follow my duty and share the wisdom with you leavingits implementation up to you my point is this never do anythingbecause you have to the only reason to do something is becauseyou want to and because you know it is the right thing for you to do     sounds reasonable julian dont worry i havent felt for evena moment that you were forcing any of this information down mythroat anyway the only thing that could ever be forced down mythroat these days would be a box of donuts — and that wouldnttake much i quipped    julian smiled gingerly thanks pal now to answer yourquestion my suggestion is that you try the heart of the rosemethod at the same time every day and in the same place everyday there is tremendous power in a ritual sports stars who eatthe same meal or tie their shoes the same way before the big gameare tapping into the power of ritual members of a church whoperform the same rites wear the same robes are using the powerof ritual even business people who walk the same route or talkthe same talk before a big presentation are applying the power ofritual you see when you insert any activity into your routine bydoing it the same way at the same time every day it quickly growsinto a habit    for example most people will do the same thing upon wakingup without giving any thought to what they are doing they opentheir eyes get out of bed walk to the bathroom and start brushingtheir teeth so staying with your goal for a period of twentyonedays and performing the new activity at the same time for each ofthese days will insert it into your routine soon you will beperforming the new habit whether it is meditation getting upearlier or reading for an hour every day with the same ease thatyou feel while brushing your teeth    the final step for attaining goals and advancing along thepath of purpose    the final step in the sages method is one that is equallyapplicable as you advance along the path of your life    my cup is still empty i said respectfully    enjoy the process the sages of sivana often spoke of thisphilosophy they truly believed that a day without laughter or aday without love was a day without life    im not sure i follow you    all im saying is make sure that you have fun while you areadvancing along the path of your goals and purpose never forgetthe importance of living with unbridled exhilaration neverneglect to see the exquisite beauty in all living things today andthis very moment that you and i are sharing is a gift remainspirited joyful and curious stay focused on your lifework and ongiving selfless service to others the universe will take care ofeverything else this is one of natures truest laws    and never regret what has happened in the past    exactly there is no chaos in this universe there is apurpose for everything that has ever happened to you andeverything that will happen to you remember what i told youjohn every experience offers lessons so stop majoring in minorthings enjoy your life    is that it    i still have much wisdom to share with you are you tired    not in the least actually i feel pretty pumped up you arequite the motivator julian have you ever thought about aninfomercial i asked mischievously    i dont understand he replied gently    never mind just one of my feeble attempts at humor    okay before we move along with yogi ramans fable there isone last point about reaching your goals and your dreams that iwould like to impress on you    go for it    there is one word which the sages spoke of in almostreverential terms     do tell     this simple word seemed to carry a depth of meaning forthem and it peppered their daily talk the word i am speaking of ispassion and it is a word you must constantly keep at the forefrontof your mind as you follow your mission and attain your goals aburning sense of passion is the most potent fuel for your dreamshere in our society we have lost our passion we do not do thingsbecause we love to do them we do things because we feel we haveto do them this is a formula for misery and i am not speaking ofromantic passion although this is another ingredient for asuccessful inspired existence what i am talking about is a passionfor life reclaim the joy of waking up every morning full of energyand exhilaration breathe the fire of passion into all that you doyou will quickly reap great material as well as spiritual rewards     you make it sound so easy     it is from tonight onwards take complete control of yourlife decide once and for all to be the master of your fate runyour own race discover your calling and you will start toexperience the ecstacy of an inspired life finally alwaysremember that what lies behind you and what lies in front of youis nothing when compared to what lies within you     thanks julian i really

cup of tea the morning will soon be upon us do youwant me to continue or have you had enough for one night    there was no way that i was going to let this man who heldsuch gems of wisdom within his grasp stop without completing hisstory at the outset his tale seemed fantastic but as i listened tohim as i absorbed the ageless philosophy that had been bestowedupon him i came to believe deeply in what he was saying thesewere not the superficial selfserving ruminations of some twobithuckster julian was the real thing he clearly walked his talk andhis message rang true i trusted him    please continue julian i have all the time in the world thekids are sleeping at their grandparents house tonight and jennywont be up for hours     sensing my sincerity he continued with the symbolic fable thatyogi raman had offered him to illustrate his wisdom on cultivatinga richer more radiant life     i have told you that the garden represents the fertile gardenof your mind a garden that is filled with delightful treasures andboundless riches i have also spoken of the lighthouse and how itrepresents the power of goals and the importance of discoveringyour calling in life you will recall that as the fable continues thedoor of the lighthouse slowly opens and out walks a ninefoottallninehundredpound japanese sumo wrestler     sounds like a bad godzilla movie     i used to love those when i was a kid     me too but dont let me distract you i replied     the sumo wrestler represents a very important element inthe lifechanging system of the sages of sivana yogi raman toldme that many centuries ago in the ancient east the great teachersdeveloped and refined a philosophy called kaizen this japaneseword means constant and neverending improvement and its thepersonal trademark of every man and woman who is living asoaring fully awakened existence     how did the concept of kaizen enrich the lives of the sagesi asked     as i mentioned earlier john success on the outside beginswith success on the inside if you really want to improve your outerworld whether this means your health your relationships or yourfinances you must first improve your inner world the mosteffective way to do this is through the practice of continuous selfimprovement selfmastery is the dna of life mastery     julian i hope you dont mind me saying it but all this talkabout ones inner world sounds more than a little esoteric to meremember im just a middleclass lawyer from the leafy suburbswith a minivan sitting in the driveway and a lawnboy in thegarage     look everything you have told me so far makes sense as amatter of fact much of what you have shared with me appears tobe common sense although i know that common sense is anythingbut common in this day and age i must tell you though im havinga little difficulty with this notion of kaizen and improving my innerworld what exactly are we talking about here     julian was agile in his response in our society we all toooften label the ignorant as weak however those who expresstheir lack of knowledge and seek instruction find the path toenlightenment before anyone else your questions are honest andshow me that you are open to fresh ideas change is the mostpowerful force in our society today most people fear it the wiseembrace it zen tradition speaks of a beginners mind those whokeep their minds open to new concepts — those whose cups arealways empty — will always move to higher levels of achievementand fulfillment never be reluctant to ask even the most basic ofquestions questions are the most effective method of elicitingknowledge    thanks but i still am unclear about kaizen    when i speak of improving your inner world i am simplyspeaking of selfimprovement and personal expansion and it is thebest thing you can do for yourself you might think that you are toobusy to spend time working on yourself this would be a very bigmistake you see when you have taken the time to build a strongcharacter full of discipline energy power and optimism you canhave anything and do anything you want in your outer worldwhen you have cultivated a deep sense of faith in your abilities andan indomitable spirit nothing can stop you from succeeding in allyour pursuits and living with great rewards taking the time tomaster your mind to care for the body and to nourish your soulwill put you in a position to develop more richness and vitality inyour life it is as epictetus said so many years ago no man is freewho is not a master of himself     so kaizen is actually a very practical concept     very think about it john how could a person possibly leada corporation if he cannot even lead himself how could younurture a family if you havent learned to nurture and care foryourself how could you possibly do good if you dont even feelgood do you see my point     i nodded in full agreement this was the first time i had givenany serious thought to the importance of improving myself i hadalways thought that all those people i would see on the subwayreading books with titles like the power of positive thinking ormegaliving were troubled souls desperate for some form ofmedicine to get them back on course now i realized that thosewho took the time to strengthen themselves were the strongestand that it was only through improving ones self that one couldever hope to improve the lot of others i then started to reflect onall the things i could improve i really could use the added energyand good health that exercising would surely bring riddingmyself of my nasty temper and my habit of interrupting othersmight do wonders for my relationship with my wife and kids anderasing my worry habit would give me the peace of mind and deephappiness i had been searching for the more i thought about itthe more potential improvements i saw    as i started to see all the positive things that would flood intomy life through the cultivation of good habits i grew excited buti realized that julian was talking about far more than theimportance of daily exercise a healthful diet and a balancedlifestyle what he had learned in the himalayas was deeper andmore meaningful than this he spoke of the importance of buildingstrength of character developing mental toughness and livingwith courage he told me that these three attributes would leadone not only to a virtuous life but to a life filled with achievementsatisfaction and inner peace courage was a quality everyonecould cultivate and one that would pay huge dividends over thelong run     what does courage have to do with selfleadership andpersonal development i wondered aloud     courage allows you to run your own race courage allows youto do whatever you want to do because you know that it is rightcourage gives you the selfcontrol to persist where others havefailed ultimately the degree of courage you live with determinesthe amount of fulfillment you receive it allows you to truly realizeall the exquisite wonders of the epic that is your life and thosewho master themselves have an abundance of courage    okay i am starting to understand the power of working onmyself where do i start    julian returned to his conversation with yogi raman high atopthe mountains on what he remembered as a remarkably starryand gloriously beautiful night    initially i too had trouble with the notion of selfimprovement after all i was a tough harvardtrained legalgunslinger who had no time for new age theories forced on me bywhat i thought were people with bad haircuts who hung out atairports i was wrong it was this closemindedness that washolding my life back all of those years the more i listened to yogiraman and the more i reflected on the pain and suffering of myformer world the more i welcomed the philosophy of kaizenconstant and neverending enrichment of the mind body and soulinto my new life julian asserted     why am i hearing so much about the mind body and soulthese days it seems i cant even turn on the tube withoutsomeone making mention of it     this is the trilogy of your human endowments to improveyour mind without the cultivation of your physical gifts would be avery hollow victory elevating your mind and body to their highestlevel without nurturing your soul would leave you feeling veryempty and unfulfilled but when you dedicate your energies tounlocking the full potential of all three of your humanendowments you will taste the divine ecstacy of an enlightenedlife    youve got me pretty excited pal    as to your question about where to start i promise that i willgive you a number of ancient yet powerful techniques in a fewmoments but first i must share a practical illustration with youget into pushup position    good grief julians become a drill sergeant i silentlythought being curious and wishing to keep my cup empty icomplied    now do as many pushups as you can possibly do dont stopuntil you truly are certain that you cannot do any more    i struggled with the exercise my twohundredandfifteenpound frame not being used to much more than walking to thenearest mcdonalds with my kids or meandering through a roundof golf with my law partners the first fifteen pushups were pureagony with the heat of that summer evening adding to mydiscomfort i started to sweat profusely however i wasdetermined not to show any signs of weakness and carried on untilmy vanity started to give way along with my arms at twentythree pushups i gave up     no more julian this is killing me what are you trying to dohere     are you certain that you cant do any more     im sure cmon give me a break the only lesson im goingto learn from this is what to do for a heart attack     do ten more then you can rest commanded julian     youve got to be kidding     but i continued one two five eight and finally ten i layon the floor in total exhaustion     i went through precisely the same experience with yogiraman the night he shared his special fable with me said julianhe told me that pain was a great teacher     what could anyone possibly learn from an experience likethis i asked breathlessly     yogi raman and all of the sages of sivana for that matterbelieved that people grow the most when they enter the zone ofthe unknown     okay but what does that have to do with making me do allthose pushups     you told me after you had done twentythree that youcouldnt do any more you told me that this was your absolutelimit yet when i challenged you to do more you responded withanother ten pushups you had more inside you and when youreached for your resources you received more yogi ramanexplained a fundamental truth to me whilst i was his student theonly limits on your life are those that you set yourself when youdare to get out of your circle of comfort and explore the unknownyou start to liberate your true human potential this is the firststep towards selfmastery and mastery over every othercircumstance in your life when you push beyond your limits justas you did in this little demonstration you unlock mental andphysical reserves that you never thought you had    fascinating i thought come to think of it i had recentlyread in a book that the average person uses only a minute measureof his human capacity i wondered what we could do if we startedusing the remaining reservoir of our abilities    julian sensed he was on a roll    you practice the art of kaizen by pushing yourself dailywork hard to improve your mind and body nourish your spiritdo the things you fear start to live with unbridled energy andlimitless enthusiasm watch the sun rise dance in a rain showerbe the person you dream of being do the things you have alwayswanted to do but didnt because you tricked yourself intobelieving that you were too young too old too rich or too poorprepare to live a soaring fully alive life in the east they say thatluck favors the prepared mind i believe that life favors theprepared mind    julian continued his passionate discourse identify the thingsthat are holding you back are you scared of speaking or do youhave trouble in your relationships do you lack a positive attitudeor do you need more energy make a written inventory of yourweaknesses satisfied people are far more thoughtful than otherstake the time to reflect on what it is that might be keeping youfrom the life you really want and know deep down you can haveonce you have identified what your weaknesses are the next stepis to face them head on and attack your fears if you fear publicspeaking sign up to give twenty speeches if you fear starting anew business or getting out of a dissatisfying relationship musterevery ounce of your inner resolve and do it this might be the firsttaste of real freedom that you have experienced in years fear isnothing more than a mental monster you have created a negativestream of consciousness      fear is nothing more than a negative stream of consciousnessi like that you mean all my fears are nothing more than imaginarylittle gremlins that have crept into my mind over the years      exactly john every time they have prevented you fromtaking some action you have added fuel to their fire but when youconquer your fears you conquer your life     i need an example     sure lets take public speaking an activity most people fearmore than death itself when i was a litigator i actually sawlawyers who were scared of stepping into court they would doanything including settling their clients otherwise worthy casesjust to avoid the pain of getting up on their feet inside a packedcourtroom     ive seen them too     do you actually think that they were born with this fear     i sure hope not     study a baby she has no limits her mind is a lush landscapeof potential and possibility properly cultivated it will lead her togreatness filled with negativity it will lead her to mediocrity atbest what i am saying is this no experience whether it is publicspeaking or asking your boss for a raise or swimming in a sunsoaked lake or walking along the beach on a moonlit night isinherently painful or pleasant it is your thinking that makes it so     interesting     a baby could be trained to view a glorious sunny day asdepressing a child could be trained to see a puppy as a viciousanimal an adult could be trained to see a drug as a pleasantvehicle for release its all a matter of conditioning isnt it     sure     the same holds true of fear fear is a conditioned response alifesucking habit that can easily consume your energy creativityand spirit if you are not careful when fear rears its ugly headbeat it down quickly the best way to do that is to do the thing youfear understand the anatomy of fear it is your own creation likeany other creation it is just as easy to tear it down as it is to erectit methodically search for and then destroy every fear that hassecretly slid into the fortress of your mind this alone will give youenormous confidence happiness and peace of mind     can a persons mind actually be fully fearless i asked     great question the answer is an unequivocal and emphaticyes each and every one of the sages of sivana was absolutelyfearless you could see it in the way they walked you could see itin the way they talked you could see it when you looked deep intotheir eyes and ill tell you something else john     what i asked fascinated by what i was hearing     i too am fearless i know myself and i have come to see thatmy natural state is one of indomitable strength and unlimitedpotential it was just that i was blocked by all those years of selfneglect and unbalanced thinking ill tell you another thing whenyou erase fear from your mind you start to look younger and yourhealth becomes more vibrant     ah the old mindbody connection i replied hoping to maskmy ignorance     yes the sages of the east have known about it for over fivethousand years hardly new age he said with a broad grinlighting up his radiant face     the sages shared another powerful principle with me whichi think about often i think it will be invaluable to you as you walkthe path of selfleadership and personal mastery it has given memotivation at times when i feel like taking things easy thephilosophy can be stated succinctly what sets highly actualizedpeople apart from those who never live inspired lives is that theydo those things that less developed people dont like doing—eventhough they might not like doing them either     truly enlightened people those who experience deephappiness daily are prepared to put off shortterm pleasure forthe sake of longterm fulfillment so they tackle their weaknessesand fears head on even if dipping into the zone of the unknownbrings with it a measure of discomfort they resolve to live by thewisdom of kaizen improving every aspect of themselvesceaselessly and continuously with time things that were oncedifficult become easy fears that once prevented them from all thehappiness health and prosperity they deserved fall to the waysidelike stickmen toppled by a hurricane     so youre suggesting that i must change myself before ichange my life     yes its like that old story my favorite professor told mewhen i was in law school one night a father was relaxing with hisnewspaper after a long day at the office his son who wanted toplay kept on pestering him finally fed up the father ripped out apicture of the globe that was in the paper and tore it into ahundred tiny pieces here son go ahead and try to put this backtogether he said hoping that this would keep the little boy busylong enough for him to finish reading his paper to his amazementhis son returned after only one minute with the globe perfectlyback together when the startled father asked how he achievedthis feat the son smiled gently and replied dad on the other sideof the globe there was a picture of a person and once i got theperson together the world was okay    thats a great story    you see john the wisest people i have ever met from thesages of sivana to my professors at harvard law school all seemto know the key formula for happiness    do continue i said with a hint of impatience    its precisely what i said earlier happiness comes through theprogressive realization of a worthy objective when you are doingwhat you truly love to do you are bound to find deep contentment    if happiness comes to everyone who simply does what theylove doing why are so many people miserable    fair point john doing what you love whether this meansgiving up the work you are presently doing to become an actor orspending less time on those things that are less important to maketime for those things that are more meaningful requires a greatdeal of courage it requires you to step out of your comfort zoneand change is always a little uncomfortable at first it is also morethan a little risky having said this this is the surest way to designa more joyful life    exactly how does one go about building courage   its the same as the story once you get yourself togetheryour world will be okay once you master your mind body andcharacter happiness and abundance will flow into your life almostmagically but you must spend some time daily working onyourself even if for only ten or fifteen minutes     and what does the ninefoottall ninehundredpoundjapanese sumo wrestler symbolize in yogi ramans fable     our hefty friend will be your constant reminder of the powerof kaizen the japanese word for constant selfexpansion andprogress     in just a few hours julian had revealed the most powerful —and the most astonishing — information that i had ever heard inmy lifetime i had learned of the magic in my own mind and itstreasure trove of potential i had learned highly practicaltechniques to still the mind and focus its power on my desires anddreams i had learned the importance of having a definite purposein life and of setting clear goals in every aspect of my personalprofessional and spiritual world now i had been exposed to theageless principle of selfmastery kaizen    how can i practice the art of kaizen    i will give you ten ancient yet supremely effective rituals thatwill lead you far along the path of personal mastery if you applythem on a daily basis with faith in their utility you will observeremarkable results in just one month from today if you continueto apply them incorporating the techniques into your routine suchthat they become habits you are bound to reach a state of perfecthealth limitless energy lasting happiness and peace of mindultimately you will reach your divine destiny — for this is yourbirthright    yogi raman offered the ten rituals to me with great faith inwhat he termed their exquisiteness and i think you will agreethat i am living proof of their power i simply ask that you listento what i have to say and judge the results for yourself    lifechanging results in only thirty days i asked indisbelief    yes the quid pro quo is that you must set aside at least onehour a day for thirty consecutive days to practice the strategies iam about to offer to you this investment in yourself is all it takesand please dont tell me that you dont have the time    but i dont i said honestly my practice is really booming idont have ten minutes to myself let alone a full hour julian    as i told you saying that you do not have the time to improveyourself whether this means improving your mind or nourishingyour spirit is much like saying you do not have time to stop for gasbecause you are too busy driving eventually it will catch up withyou    really    really    how so    let me put it this way you are very much like a highperformance race car worth millions of dollars a welloiled highlysophisticated machine    why thank you julian    your mind is the greatest wonder of the universe and yourbody has the capacity to perform feats that might astonish you    agreed    knowing the value of this high performance multimilliondollar machine would it be wise to run it full out every minute ofevery day without taking a pit stop to let the motor cool down    of course not    well then why are you not taking some time every day foryour personal pit stop or rest break why are you not taking thetime to cool down the high performance engine of your mind doyou see my point taking the time to renew yourself is the mostimportant thing you can do ironically taking time out from yourhectic schedule for selfimprovement and personal enrichmentwill dramatically improve your effectiveness once you get backinto it     one hour a day for thirty days is all it takes     its the magic formula i was always searching for i wouldprobably have paid a couple of million dollars for it in my old glorydays if i had understood its importance little did i know that itwas free as is all priceless knowledge having said this you mustbe disciplined and apply the strategies which make up the formuladaily with utter conviction in their value     this is not a quickfix type deal once you are in you are in itfor the long term     what do you mean     spending one hour a day tending to yourself will surely giveyou dramatic results in thirty days — provided you do the rightthings it takes about one month to fully install a new habit afterthis period the strategies and techniques you will learn will fit likea second skin the key is that you must keep on practicing themevery day if you want to keep on seeing the results     fair enough i agreed julian clearly had unlocked awellspring of personal vitality and inner serenity in his own lifeactually his transformation from a sickly old litigator to a radiantenergetic philosopher was nothing less than miraculous at thatmoment i resolved to dedicate one hour a day to implementing thetechniques and principles i was about to hear i decided to work onimproving myself before working to change others as had been myhabit maybe i too could undergo a mantlelike transformationit was surely worth a try     that night sitting on the floor of my cluttered living room ilearned what julian called the ten rituals of radiant livingsome of them required a little concentrated effort on my partothers could be performed effortlessly all were intriguing andrich with the promise of extraordinary things to come      the first strategy was known to the sages as the ritual ofsolitude this involves nothing more than ensuring that your dailyschedule includes a mandatory period of peace      just what is a period of peace      it is a period of time as little as fifteen minutes or as much asfifty wherein you explore the healing power of silence and come toknow who you really are julian explained      sort of a rest break for that overheated engine of mine isuggested with a slight smile      thats a pretty accurate way of looking at it have you everbeen on a long road trip with your family      sure every summer we drive down to the islands to spend acouple of weeks with jennys parents      okay do you ever make pitstops along the way      yes for food or if im feeling a little sleepy ill take a quicknap after having listened to my kids fight in the back seat for sixhours      well think of the ritual of solitude as a pitstop for the soulits purpose is selfrenewal and this is accomplished by spendingtime alone immersed in the beautiful blanket of silence      what is so special about silence      good question solitude and quiet connects you to yourcreative source and releases the limitless intelligence of theuniverse you see john the mind is like a lake in our chaoticworld most peoples minds are not still we are full of innerturbulence however by simply taking the time to be still andquiet every day the lake of the mind becomes as smooth as a plateof glass this inner quietness brings with it a wealth of benefitsincluding a deep sense of wellbeing inner peace and boundlessenergy you will even sleep better and enjoy a renewed feeling ofbalance in your daytoday activities     where should i go for this period of peace     theoretically you could do it anywhere from your bedroom toyour office the key is to find a place of true quiet — and beauty     how does beauty fit into the equation     beautiful images soothe a ruffled soul julian observed witha deep sigh a bouquet of roses or a simple solitary daffodil willhave a highly salutary effect on your senses and relax you no endideally you should savor such beauty in a space that will serve asa sanctuary of the self     whats that     basically it is a place that will become your secret forum formental and spiritual expansion this might be a spare room inyour house or simply a peaceful corner of a small apartment thepoint is to reserve a spot for your renewal activities a place thatsits there quietly awaiting your arrival     i love the sound of that i think having a silent place to go towhen i come home from work would make a world of difference icould decompress for a while and let go of the stresses of the dayit would probably make me a much nicer person to be around     that brings up another important point the ritual ofsolitude works best when you practice it at the same time everyday     why     because then it becomes integrated into your routine as aritual by practicing it at the same time every day a daily dose ofsilence will soon become a habit that you will never neglect andpositive life habits inevitably guide you to your destiny     anything else     yes if at all possible commune with nature daily a quickwalk through the woods or even a few minutes spent cultivatingyour tomato garden in the backyard will reconnect you to thewellspring of calm that may now be dormant within you beingwith nature also allows you to tune in to the infinite wisdom of yourhighest self this selfknowledge will move you into the uncharteddimensions of your personal power never forget this advisedjulian his voice rising with passion     has this ritual worked well for you julian     absolutely i rise with the sun and the first thing i do is headoff to my secret sanctuary there i explore the heart of the rosefor as long as need be some days i spend hours in quietcontemplation on other days i spend only ten minutes the resultis more or less the same a deep sense of inner harmony and anabundance of physical energy which brings me to the secondritual this is the ritual of physicality     sounds interesting whats it about     its about the power of physical care     huh     its simple the ritual of physicality is based on the principlethat says as you care for the body so you care for the mind as youprepare your body so you prepare your mind as you train yourbody so you train your mind take some time every single day tonourish the temple of your body through vigorous exercise getyour blood circulating and your body moving did you know thatthere are 168 hours in a week     no not really      its true at least five of those hours should be invested insome form of physical activity the sages of sivana practiced theancient discipline of yoga to awaken their physical potential andlive a strong dynamic existence it was an extraordinary sight tosee these marvellous physical specimens who had managed toageproof their lives standing on their heads in the center of theirvillage     have you tried yoga julian jenny started practicing it lastsummer and says it has added five years to her life     there is no one strategy that will magically transform yourlife john let me be the first to say this lasting and profoundchange comes through the continued application of a number ofthe methods i have shared with you but yoga is an extremelyeffective way to unlock your reserves of vitality i do my yogaevery morning and it is one of the best things that i do for myselfit not only rejuvenates my body it completely focuses my mind ithas even unblocked my creativity it is a terrific discipline     did the sages do anything else to care for their bodies     yogi raman and his brothers and sisters also believed thatvigorous walking in natural surroundings whether high on themountain paths or deep in the lush forests worked wonders forrelieving fatigue and restoring the body to its natural state ofvibrancy when the weather was too harsh to walk they wouldexercise within the security of their huts they might miss a mealbut they would never miss their daily round of exercise    what did they have in their huts nordictrack machines iquipped    not quite sometimes they would practice yoga posturesother times i would catch a glimpse of them doing a set or two ofonehanded pushups i really think it didnt matter too much tothem what they did so long as they moved their bodies and got thefresh air of their breathtaking surroundings flowing throughtheir lungs     what does breathing fresh air have to do with anything     ill answer your question with one of yogi ramans favoritesayings to breathe properly is to live properly     breathing is that important i asked in surprise     quite early on in sivana the sages taught me that the fastestway to double or even triple the amount of energy i had was tolearn the art of effective breathing     but dont we all know how to breathe even a newborn baby     not really john while most of us know how to breathe tosurvive we have never learned how to breathe to thrive most ofus breathe far too shallowly and in so doing we fail to take inenough oxygen to run the body at an optimal level     sounds like proper breathing involves a lot of science     it does and the sages treated it that way their philosophywas simple take in more oxygen through efficient breathing andyou liberate your energy reserves along with your natural state ofvitality     okay so where do i start     its actually pretty easy two or three times a day take a minuteor two to think about breathing more deeply and effectively     how do i know if im breathing effectively     well your belly should move out slightly this indicates thatyou are breathing from the abdomen which is good a trick thatyogi raman taught me was to cup my hands over my stomach ifthey moved out as i inhaled my breathing technique was proper     very interesting     if you like that then you will love the third ritual of radiantliving said julian     which is     the ritual of live nourishment in my days as a litigator ilived off of a steady diet of steaks fries and other types of junkfood sure i ate at the finest restaurants in the country but i stillfilled my body with junk i didnt know it at the time but this wasone of the main sources of my discontent     really     yes a poor diet has a pronounced effect on your life it drainsyour mental and physical energy it affects your moods and ithampers the clarity of your mind yogi raman put it this way asyou nourish your body so you nourish your mind     i assume then that you changed your diet     radically and it made an amazing difference in the way i feltand looked i always thought that i was so run down because ofthe stresses and strains of my work and because the wrinkledfingers of old age were reaching out for me in sivana i learnedthat much of my lethargy was due to the lowoctane fuel i waspumping into my body    what did the sages of sivana eat to stay so youthful andbright    live foods came the efficient reply    huh    live foods are the answer live foods are foods that are notdead    cmon julian what are live foods i asked impatiently    basically live foods are those which are created through thenatural interaction of the sun air soil and water what im talkingabout here is a vegetarian diet fill your plate with freshvegetables fruits and grains and you might just live forever    is that possible    most of the sages were well over one hundred and theyshowed no signs of slowing down and just last week i read in thepaper about a group of people living on the tiny island of okinawain the east china sea researchers are flocking to the islandbecause they are fascinated by the fact that it holds the largestconcentration of centenarians in the world     what have they learned     that a vegetarian diet is one of their main longevity secrets     but is this type of diet healthy you wouldnt think that itwould give you much strength remember im still a busylitigator julian     this is the diet that nature intended it is alive vital andsupremely healthy the sages have lived by this diet for manythousands of years they call it a sattvic or pure diet and as toyour concern about strength the most powerful animals on theplanet ranging from gorillas to elephants wear the badge ofproud vegetarians did you know that a gorilla has about thirtytimes the strength of a man    thanks for that important tidbit of information    look the sages are not extreme people all of their wisdomwas based on the ageless principle that one must live a life ofmoderation and do nothing to extremes so if you like meat youcan certainly keep eating it just remember that you are ingestingdead food if you can cut back on the amount of red meat that youeat it is really hard to digest and since your digestive system isone of the most energyconsuming processes of your entire bodyvaluable energy reserves are needlessly depleted by this foodstuffdo you see what im getting at just compare how you feel aftereating a steak with your energy levels after eating a salad if youdont want to become a strict vegetarian at least start having asalad with every meal and fruit for dessert even this will make ahuge difference in the quality of your physical life     that doesnt seem like it would be too hard to do i repliedive been hearing a lot about the power of a largely vegetariandiet just last week jenny told me about a study in finland whereit was found that thirtyeight percent of new vegetarians studiedreported that they felt far less tired and much more alert afteronly seven months of this new way of life i should try eating asalad with every meal looking at you julian i might even makethe salad the meal     try it for about a month and judge the results for yourselfyou will feel phenomenal     okay if its good enough for the sages its good enough forme i promise you i will give it a shot it doesnt sound like toomuch of a stretch and anyway im getting pretty tired of firing upthe barbeque every night     if i have sold you on the ritual of live nourishment i thinkyou will love the fourth one     your student is still holding his empty cup     the fourth ritual is known as the ritual of abundantknowledge it centers around the whole notion of lifelong learningand expanding your knowledge base for the good of yourself andall those around you     the old knowledge is power idea     it involves far more than that john knowledge is onlypotential power for the power to be manifested it must beapplied most people know what they should do in any givensituation or in their lives for that matter the problem is that theydont take daily consistent action to apply the knowledge andrealize their dreams the ritual of abundant knowledge is allabout becoming a student of life even more importantly itrequires that you use what you have learned in the classroom ofyour existence    what did yogi raman and the other sages do to live thisritual    they had many subrituals which they performed on a dailybasis as a tribute to the ritual of abundant knowledge one of themost important strategies is also one of the easiest you can evenstart doing it today     it wont take up too much time will it    julian smiled these techniques tools and tips i am sharingwith you will make you more productive and effective than youhave ever been dont be penny wise pound foolish     say what     consider those who say that they do not have the time to backup their computers because they are too busy working on themyet when those machines crash and months of important work islost they regret not investing a few moments a day in saving it doyou see my point     get my priorities straight     exactly try not to live your life bound by the shackles of yourschedule instead focus on those things that your conscience andyour heart tell you to do when you invest in yourself and start todevote yourself to raising your mind body and character to theirhighest levels you will almost feel as if you have a personalnavigator inside you telling you which things you must do to seethe greatest and most rewarding results you will stop worryingabout your clock and start living your life   point well taken so what was that simple subritual you wereabout to teach me i asked     read regularly reading for thirty minutes a day will dowonders for you but i must caution you do not read justanything you must be very selective about what you put into thelush garden of your mind it must be immensely nourishingmake it something that will improve both you and the quality ofyour life     what did the sages read     they spent many of their waking moments reading and rereading the ancient teachings of their ancestors they devouredthis philosophical literature i still remember seeing thesewonderful looking people seated on little bamboo chairs readingtheir strangely bound books with the subtle smiles ofenlightenment unfolding across their lips it was in sivana that ireally learned the power of the book and the principle that a bookis the best friend of the wise     so i should start reading every good book i can get myhands on     yes and no came the reply i would never tell you not toread as many books as you can but remember some books aremeant to be tasted some books are meant to be chewed andfinally some books are meant to be swallowed whole whichbrings me to another point     youre feeling hungry     no john julian laughed i simply want to tell you that totruly get the best out of a great book you must study it not justread it go through it as you do when you read those contracts yourbig clients bring to you for your legal opinion really consider itwork with it become one with it the sages would read many of thebooks of wisdom in their vast library ten or fifteen times theytreated great books as scriptures holy documents of divine origin     wow reading is really that important     thirty minutes a day will make a delightful difference in yourlife because you will quickly start to see the vast reserves ofknowledge available for your use every answer to every problemyou have ever faced is in print if you want to be a better lawyerfather friend or lover there are books out there that will rocket youto those goals all the mistakes you will ever make in your life havealready been made by those that have walked before you do youreally think that the challenges you are facing are unique to you     ive never thought about it julian but i see what you aresaying and i know you are right     all the problems anyone has ever and will ever face over thecourse of their lifetime have already been made julian assertedmore importantly the answers and solutions are all recorded onthe pages of books read the right books learn how those whohave preceded you have handled the challenges you are currentlyfacing apply their strategies for success and you will beastonished by the improvements you will note in your life     what exactly are the right books i asked quickly realizingthat julians point was an excellent one     ill leave that to your good judgment my friend personallysince i have returned from the east i spend the better part of mydays reading biographies of the men and women i have come toadmire and a great deal of the wisdom of literature     any titles you could recommend to an eager young beaveri said flashing a broad grin     sure you will thrive on the biography of the great americanbenjamin franklin i think you will also find much growth impetusfrom mahatma gandhis autobiography entitled the story of myexperiments with truth i also suggest that you read siddharthaby hermann hesse the highly practical philosophy of marcusaurelius and some of the work of seneca you might even readthink and grow rich by napoleon hill i read it last week andthought it was very profound     think and grow rich i exclaimed but i thought you leftall of that behind you after your heart attack im really sick andtired of all the makemoneyfast manuals that are being peddledout there by snakeoil salesmen preying on the weak     easy big fella i couldnt agree with you more offeredjulian with all the warmth and patience of a wise lovinggrandfather i too want to restore the character ethic to oursociety that little book is not about making a lot of money it isabout making a lot of life i will be the first to tell you that there isa huge difference between wellbeing and being well off ive livedit and know the pain of a moneydriven life think and grow richis about abundance including spiritual abundance and how toattract all that is good into your life you might do well to read itbut i will not press the point     sorry julian i didnt mean to sound like an aggressivelitigator i offered apologetically i guess my temper gets thebetter of me sometimes one more thing i need to improve ireally am grateful for all that you are sharing with me     no problem water under the bridge my point simply is readand keep reading do you want to know something elseinteresting     what     its not what you will get out of the books that is so enriching— it is what the books will get out of you that will ultimatelychange your life you see john books do not actually teach youanything new    really    really books simply help you to see what is already withinyour self thats what enlightenment is all about after all myjourneying and exploring i found that i have actually come fullcircle back to the point from which i started as a young boy butnow i know myself and all that i am and can be    so the ritual of abundant knowledge is all about reading andexploring the wealth of information out there    partly for now read thirty minutes a day the rest will comenaturally julian said with a hint of mystery     okay whats the fifth ritual of radiant living     it is the ritual of personal reflection the sages were firmbelievers in the power of inner contemplation by taking the timeto get to know yourself you will connect to a dimension of yourbeing that you never knew you had     sounds pretty deep     its actually a very practical concept you see we all havemany sleeping talents inside of us by taking the time to get toknow them we kindle them however silent contemplation willdeliver even more than this this practice will make you strongermore at ease with yourself and wiser it is a very rewarding use ofyour mind    im still a little fuzzy on the concept julian    fair enough it was also foreign to me when i first heard itboiled down to its basic form personal reflection is nothing morethan the habit of thinking    but dont we all think isnt that part of being human    well most of us do think the problem is that most peoplethink just enough to survive what i am speaking about with thisritual is thinking enough to thrive when you read ben franklinsbiography you will see what i mean every evening after a full dayof productive work he would retire to a silent corner of his homeand reflect on his day he would consider all of his actions andwhether they were positive and constructive or whether they wereof the negative sort in need of repair by clearly knowing what hewas doing wrong in his days he could take immediate steps toimprove and advance along the path of selfmastery the sages didthe same every night they would retire to the sanctuary of theirhuts covered by fragrant rose petals and sit in deep contemplationyogi raman would actually take a written inventory of his day     what kinds of things would he write down i asked     first he would list all of his activities from the personal careactivities of his morning to his interactions with the other sages tohis forays into the forest in search of firewood and fresh foodinterestingly he would also write down the thoughts he had runthrough his mind during that particular day     isnt that hard to do i can hardly remember what i thoughtfive minutes ago let alone twelve hours ago     not if you practice this ritual daily you see anyone can attainthe kind of results i have attained anyone the real problem isthat too many people suffer from that dreadful disease known asexcusitus     i think i might have contracted that one in the past i said infull knowledge of what my wise friend was saying     stop making excuses and just do it julian exclaimed hisvoice resonating with the strength of conviction     do what     take the time to think get into the regular habit of personalintrospection once yogi raman had listed all that he had done andall that he had thought in one column he would then do anassessment in another column as he was confronted by hisactivities and thoughts in the written form he asked himselfwhether they were positive in nature if they were he resolved tocontinue giving his precious energy to them as they would payhuge dividends in the long run    and if they were negative    then he would come up with a clear course of action to get ridof them    i think an example might help me     can it be personal julian asked     sure id love to know some of your innermost thoughts isuggested     actually i was thinking about yours    we both started to giggle like a couple of kids in a schoolyard     oh alright you always did get your way     okay lets go through just a few of the things that you didtoday write them down on that piece of paper on the coffee tablejulian instructed     i started to realize that something important was about tohappen this was the first time in years that i had actually takenthe time to do nothing but reflect on the things i was doing and thethoughts that i was thinking it was all so strange and yet sointelligent after all how could i ever hope to improve myself andmy life if i hadnt even taken the time to figure out what i wassupposed to improve    where do i start i asked    start with what you did this morning and progress throughyour day just hit a few of the highlights we still have a fair amountof ground to cover and i want to get back to yogi ramans fable ina few minutes     fine i woke up at sixthirty to the sound of my electricrooster i joked     get serious and keep going julian replied firmly     okay then i showered and shaved gobbled down a waffleand rushed off to work     and what about your family     they were all asleep anyway once i got to the office inoticed that my seventhirty appointment had been waiting theresince seven and boy was he furious     what was your response     i fought back what was i supposed to do let him push mearound     hmm okay then what happened     well things went from bad to worse the courthouse calledand told me that judge wildabest needed to see me in hischambers and if i wasnt there within ten minutes heads wouldroll you remember wildabest dont you you were the one whonicknamed him judge wild beast after he held you in contemptfor parking your ferrari in his parking spot i recalled breakinginto laughter     you would have to bring that up wouldnt you julianreplied his eyes revealing the remnants of that mischievoustwinkle he was once well known for     anyway i rushed down to the courthouse and had anotherargument with one of the clerks by the time i got back to theoffice there were twentyseven phone messages waiting for meall marked urgent need i go on     please do     well on the way home jenny called me in the car and askedme to stop by her mothers house and pick up one of those amazingpies my motherinlaw is famous for problem was that when i tookthat exit i found myself in the middle of a gridlock that was worsethan anything i have seen in ages so there i was in the middle ofrushhour traffic in ninetyfivedegree heat shaking with stressand feeling that even more time was slipping away    how did you respond    i cursed the traffic i said with complete honesty i wasactually shouting out loud inside my car do you want to know whati said    i dont think that would be the kind of thing that wouldnourish the garden of my mind julian responded with a softsmile    but it might make for good fertilizer    no thanks maybe we should stop there just take a secondand look at your day obviously in retrospect there are at least afew things that you would do differently if you had the chance     obviously     like what     hmm well first in a perfect world i would get up earlier idont think im doing myself any favors by hitting the groundrunning id like to have a little peace in the morning and easemyself into the day the heart of the rose technique you told meabout earlier sounds like it would be fun also i really would like tohave the family around the breakfast table even if only for a bowlof cereal it would give me a better sense of balance i always seemto feel that i never spend enough time with jenny and the kids     but it is a perfect world and you have a perfect life you dohave the power to control your day you do have the power to thinkgood thoughts you do have the power to live your dreams julianobserved his voice rising     i am realizing this i really am starting to feel that i canchange     great continue reflecting on your day he instructed     well i wish i hadnt yelled at my client i wish i hadntargued with the court clerk and i wish i hadnt screamed at thetraffic     the traffic doesnt care does it     it just keeps on being traffic i noted     i think you now see the power of the ritual of personalreflection by looking at what you are doing how you arespending your day and the thoughts you are thinking you giveyourself a benchmark for measuring improvement the only wayto improve tomorrow is to know what you did wrong today     and come up with a clear plan so that it doesnt happenagain i added     precisely there is nothing wrong with making mistakesmistakes are part of life and essential for growth its like thatsaying happiness comes through good judgment good judgmentcomes through experience and experience comes through badjudgment but there is something very wrong with making thesame mistakes over and over again day in and day out this showsa complete lack of selfawareness the very quality that separateshumans from animals     ive never heard that one before     well its true only a human being can step out of himself andanalyze what he is doing right and what he is doing wrong a dogcannot do this a bird cannot do this even a monkey cannot do itbut you can this is what the ritual of personal reflection is allabout figure out what is right and what is wrong in your days andin your life then set about making immediate improvements     lots to think about julian lots to think about i offeredreflectively     how about thinking about the sixth ritual for radiantliving the ritual of early awakening     uhoh i think i know whats coming     one of the best pieces of advice i learned in that faroff oasisof sivana was to rise with the sun and to start the day off wellmost of us sleep far more than we need to the average person canget by on six hours — and remain perfectly healthy and alertsleep is really nothing more than a habit and like any other habityou can train yourself to achieve the result you want sleeping lessin this case     but if i get up too early i really do feel exhausted i said     for the first few days you will feel very tired ill freely admitthis you might even feel this way for the first week of getting upnice and early please see this as a small measure of shorttermpain for a large measure of longterm gain you will always feel alittle discomfort when you are installing a new habit its sort oflike breaking in a new pair of shoes — at first its a little hard towear them but soon they fit like a glove as i told you earlier painis often the precursor to personal growth dont dread it insteadembrace it    okay i like the idea of training myself to get up earlier firstlet me ask you what does early mean    another fine question there is no ideal time just likeeverything else i have shared with you so far do what is right foryou remember yogi ramans admonishment nothing toextremes everything in moderation    getting up with the sun sounds extreme    actually it isnt there are few things more natural than risingwith the glory of the first rays of a new day the sages believedthat sunshine was a gift from heaven and while they were carefulnot to overexpose themselves they regularly had sunbaths andoften could be seen dancing playfully in the early morningsunshine i firmly believe that this was another key to theirextraordinary longevity    do you sunbathe i asked    absolutely the sun rejuvenates me when i grow tired itkeeps my mood bright in the ancient culture of the east the sunwas thought to be a connection to the soul people worshipped itas it allowed their crops to flourish along with their spiritssunlight will release your vitality and restore your emotional andphysical vibrancy it is a delightful physician when visited inmoderation of course alas i digress the point is to get up earlyevery day    hmm how do i build this ritual into my routine    here are a couple of quick tips first never forget that it isthe quality and not the quantity of sleep that is important it isbetter to have six hours of uninterrupted deep sleep than even tenhours of disturbed sleep the whole idea is to provide your bodywith rest so that its natural processes can repair and restore yourphysical dimension to its natural state of health a state that isdiminished through the stresses and struggles of daily use manyof the habits of the sages are based on the principle that one muststrive for quality rest rather than quantity sleep for exampleyogi raman would never eat after 800 pm he said that thedigestive activity it induced would reduce the quality of his sleepanother example was the sages habit of meditating to the softsounds of their harp immediately before heading off to sleep    what was the reason behind this     let me ask you john what do you do before you go to sleepevery night     i watch the news with jenny the same as most people i know     i kind of thought so replied julian with a mysterioustwinkle in his eyes     i dont get it what could possibly be wrong with getting alittle shot of the news before i go to sleep     the tenminute period before you sleep and the tenminuteperiod after you wake up are profoundly influential on yoursubconscious mind only the most inspiring and serene thoughtsshould be programmed into your mind at those times     you make the mind sound like a computer     thats a pretty fair way to look at it — what you put in is whatyou get out even more important is the fact that you alone are theprogrammer by determining the thoughts that go in you also aredetermining precisely what will come out so before you go tosleep dont watch the news or argue with anyone or even go overthe days events in your minds eye relax drink a cup of herbaltea if you like listen to some soft classical music and prepareyourself to drift off into a rich renewing slumber     it makes sense the better the sleep the less i will need     exactly and remember the ancient rule of twentyone ifyou do anything for twentyone days in a row it will be installed asa habit so stay with the earlyrising routine for about three weeksbefore you give up because it feels too uncomfortable by then itwill be a part of your life within short order you will be able to riseat 530 am or even at 500 am with ease ready to savor thesplendor of another great day  okay so lets say that i am getting up every day at fivethirtywhat do i do    your questions show that you are thinking my friend iappreciate this once you are up there are many things you cando the fundamental principle to keep in mind is the importance ofstarting your day off well as ive suggested the thoughts youthink and the actions you take in the first ten minutes after youwake up have a very marked effect on the rest of your day     seriously     absolutely think positive thoughts give a prayer of thanksfor all you have work on your gratitude list listen to some greatmusic watch the sun come up or perhaps go for a quick walk innatural surroundings if you feel up to it the sages would actuallymake themselves laugh whether they felt like it or not just to getthe happiness juices flowing early in the morning     julian i am trying very hard to keep my cup empty — and ithink you will agree that ive done pretty well for a novice butthat really sounds odd even for a band of monks living high in thehimalayas     but it is not take a guess how many times the average fouryearold laughs in a day     who knows     i do three hundred now guess how many times the averageadult in our society laughs in the course of a day     fifty i tried     try fifteen julian said smiling in satisfaction you see mypoint laughing is medicine for the soul even if you dont feel likeit look in the mirror and laugh for a couple of minutes you canthelp but feel fantastic william james said we dont laughbecause we are happy we are happy because we laugh so startyour day on a delightful footing laugh play and give thanks forall you have every day will be an exquisitely rewarding one    what do you do to start your day off on a positive footing    actually i have developed quite a sophisticated morningroutine which includes everything from the heart of the rose todrinking a couple of glasses of freshly squeezed fruit juice butthere is one strategy in particular which i would like to share withyou    sounds important    it is shortly after you have awakened go into your sanctuaryof silence get still and focused then ask yourself this questionwhat would i do today if today was my last the key is to reallyget into the meaning of this question mentally list all the thingsyou would do the people you would call and the moments youwould savor envision yourself doing these things with greatenergy visualize how you would treat your family and yourfriends even picture how you would treat total strangers if todaywas your last day on the planet as i told you earlier when you liveevery day as if it was your last your life will take on a magicalquality     and this brings me to the seventh of the rituals of radiantliving the ritual of music     i think im going to love this one i replied     im sure you will the sages loved their music it gave themthe same spiritual boost as the sun did music made them laugh itmade them dance and it made them sing it will do the same foryou never forget the power of music spend a little time with itevery day even if it is listening to a soft piece on a cassette whileyou drive to work when you feel down or weary play some musicit is one of the finest motivators i know of    aside from yourself i exclaimed sincerely just listening toyou makes me feel great you really have changed julian and notjust on the outside gone is your old cynicism gone is your formernegativity gone is your old aggressiveness you really do seem tobe at peace with yourself you have touched me tonight     hey theres more shouted julian with his fist in the airlets keep going     i wouldnt have it any other way     okay the eighth ritual is the ritual of the spoken word thesages had a series of mantras which they would recite morningnoon and night they told me that this practice was immenselyeffective in keeping them focused strong and happy     whats a mantra i asked     a mantra is nothing more than a collection of words strungtogether to create a positive effect in sanskrit man meansmind and tra means freeing so a mantra is a phrase which isdesigned to free the mind and believe me john mantrasaccomplish this objective in a very powerful way     are you using mantras in your daily routine     i sure am they are my faithful companions wherever i gowhether i am on the bus walking to the library or watching theworld go by in a park i am constantly affirming all that is good inmy world through mantras     so mantras are spoken     they do not have to be written affirmations are also veryeffective but i have found that repeating a mantra aloud has awonderful effect on my spirit when i need to feel motivated imight repeat i am inspired disciplined and energized out loudtwo or three hundred times to maintain the supreme sense ofselfconfidence i have cultivated i repeat i am strong able andcalm i even use mantras to keep me youthful and vital julianadmitted     how could a mantra keep you young     words affect the mind in a pronounced way whether they arespoken or written they are powerful influences while what yousay to others is important even more important is what you say toyourself     selftalk     exactly you are what you think about all day long you arealso what you say to yourself all day long if you say that you areold and tired this mantra will be manifested in your externalreality if you say you are weak and lack enthusiasm this too willbe the nature of your world but if you say that you are healthydynamic and fully alive your life will be transformed you see thewords you say to yourself affect your selfimage and your selfimage determines what actions you take for example if your selfimage is one of a person who lacks the confidence to do anythingof value you will only be able to take actions which are alignedwith this trait on the other hand if your selfimage is one of aradiant individual who is fearless again all your actions willcorrespond to this quality your selfimage is a selffulfillingprophecy of sorts     how so     if you believe that you are unable to do something lets sayfind that perfect partner or live a stressfree life your beliefs willaffect your selfimage in turn your selfimage will prevent youfrom taking steps to find the perfect partner or to create a serenelife for yourself it will actually sabotage any efforts you mightmake in this direction     why does it work this way     simple your selfimage is a governor of sorts it will never letyou act in a way that is inconsistent with it the beautiful thing isthat you can change your selfimage just like you can changeeverything else in your life if it is not serving to enhance itmantras are a great way accomplish this objective     and when i change my inner world i change my outerworld i said dutifully     my how quickly you learn julian said giving me thethumbsup sign he had used so much in his former life as a starlitigator     which leads us into the ninth ritual of radiant living quitenicely this is the ritual of a congruent character it is sort of anoffshoot of the selfimage concept we were just talking aboutsimply stated this ritual requires you to take daily incrementalaction to build your character strengthening your characteraffects the way you see yourself and the actions you take theactions you take come together to form your habits and this isimportant your habits lead you to your destiny perhaps yogiraman articulated the formula best when he stated you sow athought you reap an action reap an action you sow a habit sowa habit you reap a character sow a character you reap yourdestiny     what kinds of things should i do to build my character     anything that cultivates your virtues before you ask mewhat i mean by virtues let me clarify the concept the wisepeople of the himalayas believed strongly that a virtuous life wasa meaningful life so they governed all of their actions by a seriesof timeless principles     but i thought you said they governed their lives by theirpurpose     yes this is quite so but their lifes calling included living in amanner congruent to these principles ones that their ancestorsheld dear to their hearts for thousands of years     what are these principles julian i asked     they are simply stated industry compassion humilitypatience honesty and courage when all your actions arecongruent and aligned with these principles you will feel a deepsense of inner harmony and peace living this way will inevitablylead you to spiritual success this is because you will be doing whatis right you will be acting in a way that is in accordance with thelaws of nature and the laws of the universe this is when you willstart to tap into the energy of another dimension call it a higherpower if you will this is also when your life will move from theordinary into the realm of the extraordinary and you begin tosense the sacredness of your being it is the first step to lifelongenlightenment     have you tasted this experience i asked     i have and i believe you will too do the right things act in away that is congruent with your true character act with integritybe guided by your heart the rest will take care of itself you arenever alone you know replied julian     what do you mean     ill explain it to you another time perhaps for nowremember that you must do little things every day to build yourcharacter as emerson said character is higher than intellect agreat soul will be strong to live as well as to think your characteris built when you act in a way that corresponds with the principlesive just mentioned if you fail to do this true happiness willalways elude you     and the final ritual     this is the allimportant ritual of simplicity this ritualrequires you to live a simple life as yogi raman said one mustnever live in the thick of thin things focus only on your prioritiesthose activities which are truly meaningful your life will beuncluttered rewarding and exceptionally peaceful this ipromise you     he was right the moment i started to separate the wheatfrom the chaff harmony filled my life i stopped living at thefrenetic pace to which i had grown accustomed i stopped livingmy life in the eye of the tornado instead i slowed down and tookthe time to smell the proverbial roses     what things did you do to cultivate simplicity     i stopped wearing expensive clothes i kicked my addiction tosix newspapers a day i stopped needing to be available to everyoneall the time i became a vegetarian and i ate less basically ireduced my needs you see john unless you reduce your needsyou will never be fulfilled you will always be like that gambler inlas vegas staying at the roulette wheel for just one more spin inthe hope that your lucky number will come up you will always wantmore than you have how can you ever be happy    but earlier you told me that happiness comes fromachievement now you are telling me to reduce my needs and becontent with less isnt this a paradox     excellent point john brilliant in fact it might seem like acontradiction but it isnt lifelong happiness does come throughstriving to realize your dreams you are at your best when you aremoving forward the key is not to make your happinesscontingent on finding that elusive pot of gold at the end of therainbow for example even though i was a millionaire many timesover i told myself that success to me meant having three hundredmillion dollars in my bank account this was a recipe for disaster    three hundred million i asked in disbelief     three hundred million so no matter how much i had i wasnever satisfied i was always unhappy it was nothing more thangreed i can now admit this freely it was much like the story ofking midas im sure you have heard that one     sure the man who loved gold so much he prayed thateverything he touched would turn to gold when his wish wasgranted he rejoiced that was until he realized that he couldnt eatbecause his food had turned to gold and so on so forth     right similarly i was so moneydriven that i couldnt enjoyall that i had you know there came a time when all that i could eatwas bread and water julian said growing very quiet and pensive     are you serious i always thought you ate at the bestrestaurants with all those celebrity friends of yours     that was in the early days not many people know about thisbut the burden of my outofcontrol lifestyle gave me a bleedingulcer i couldnt even eat a hot dog without getting sick what a lifeall that money and all i could eat was bread and water it waspathetic really julian caught himself but im not one to live inthe past it was another one of lifes great lessons as i told youearlier pain is a powerful teacher to transcend pain i had to firstexperience it i wouldnt be where i am today without it he saidstoically    any ideas on what i should do to bring the ritual of simplicityinto my own life i asked    there are so many things you can do even little things willmake a difference    like what    stop picking up the phone every time it rings stop wastingtime reading junk mail stop eating out three times a week give upyour golfclub membership and spend more time with your kidsspend a day a week without your watch watch the sun rise everyfew days sell your cellular phone and dump the pager need icontinue julian asked rhetorically     i get the point but sell the cell phone i asked anxiouslyfeeling as a baby might at the doctors suggestion that hisumbilical cord should be cut     like ive said my duty is to share the wisdom i have learnedthrough my journey with you you need not apply every strategyto make your life work try the techniques and use those that feelright to you     i know nothing to extremes everything in moderation     precisely     i have to admit though every one of your strategies soundsgreat but will they really bring about profound shifts in my life inonly thirty days     it will take even less than thirty days — and even more saidjulian with his trademark look of dimpled mischievousness     here we go again do explain o wise one     julian will be fine although wise one would have lookedformidable on my old letterhead he joked i say it will take lessthan thirty days because true life change is spontaneous     spontaneous     yes it happens in the blink of an eye the very moment youdecide from the deepest core of your being that you will raise yourlife to its highest level in that instant you will be a changedperson one set on the course of his destiny     and why longer than thirty days     i promise you that by practicing these strategies and toolsyou will see marked improvements in one month from thismoment you will have more energy less worries more creativityand less stress in every aspect of your life having said this thesages methods are not of the quickfix kind they are agelesstraditions which are meant to be applied daily for the rest of yourdays if you stop applying them you will find that you willgradually slide back into your old ways     after julian had explained the ten rituals for radiant livingto me he paused i know that you want me to keep going so i willi believe so strongly in what i am sharing with you that i dontmind keeping you up all night perhaps this is a good time to get alittle deeper     what exactly do you mean i think all that i have heardtonight is pretty deep i said in surprise     the secrets i have explained will allow you and all those youcome into contact with to create the lives you desire but there ismuch more to the philosophy of the sages of sivana than meets theeye what i have taught you up to now has been immenselypractical but you must know something of the underlyingspiritual current which flows through the principles i haveoutlined if you do not understand what i am speaking about dontworry at this point simply take it in and chew on it for a while youcan digest it later    when the student is ready the teacher will appear    precisely said julian now smiling you always were aquick study    okay lets hear the spiritual stuff i said energeticallyunaware that it was nearly twothirty in the morning    within you lies the sun the moon the sky and all the wondersof this universe the intelligence that created these wonders is thesame force that created you all things around you come from thesame source we are all one     im not sure i follow you     every being on this earth every object on this earth has asoul all souls flow into one this is the soul of the universe yousee john when you nourish your own mind and your own spirityou are really feeding the soul of the universe when you improveyourself you are improving the lives of all those around you andwhen you have the courage to advance confidently in the directionof your dreams you begin to draw upon the power of the universeas i told you earlier life gives you what you ask of it it is alwayslistening     so selfmastery and kaizen will help me help others byhelping me help myself     something like that as you enrich your mind as you care foryour body and as you nurture your spirit you will come tounderstand exactly what i am saying     julian i know you mean well but selfmastery is a prettyhigh ideal for a 215pound family man who up to now has spentmore time on client development than personal developmentwhat happens if i fail     failure is not having the courage to try nothing more andnothing less the only thing standing between most people andtheir dreams is the fear of failure yet failure is essential to successin any endeavor failure tests us and allows us

magnificent treasures it was up to each individual todevelop the courage to walk this way there is a story he sharedwith me that i would like to pass on to you once in ancient indiathere was an evil giant who owned a magnificent castleoverlooking the sea as the giant had been away for many yearsfighting in wars the children of the nearby village used to comeinto the giants beautiful garden and play with great delight oneday the giant returned and threw all of the young children out ofhis garden never return here he yelled as he slammed the hugeoak door in disgust he then erected a huge marble wall aroundthe garden to keep the children out     winter came with bitter cold which is native to thenorthernmost parts of the indian subcontinent and the giantwished the warmth would soon return spring visited the villagewhich lay below the giants castle but the icy claws of winterrefused to leave his garden then one day the giant finally smelledthe fragrances of spring and felt the radiance of the sun throughhis windows spring has finally returned he cried running outinto the garden but the giant was unprepared for the sight whichgreeted him the children of the village had somehow managed toclimb over the castle wall and were playing in the garden it wasbecause of their presence that the garden had been transformedfrom a wintry wasteland into a lush place filled with roses daffodils and orchids all the children laughed and giggled withjoy but one from the corner of his eye the giant spotted a littleboy who was much smaller than all the other children tears ran from his eyes as he did not have the strength to climb the wall into the garden the giant felt sad for this boy and for the first time inhis life regretted his evil ways i will help this child he saidrunning towards him when all the other children saw the giantcoming they ran from the garden fearing for their lives but thetiny little boy stood his ground i will slay the giant hestammered i will defend our playground     as the giant approached the child he opened his arms i ama friend he said i have come to help you over the wall and intothe garden this will be your garden now the little boy now ahero amongst the children rejoiced in happiness and gave thegiant the golden necklace which he had always worn around hisneck this is my lucky charm he said i want you to have it     from that day on the children played with the giant in hiswonderful garden but the brave little boy whom the giant lovedthe most never did return as time went on the giant grew ill andfrail the children continued to play in the garden but the giant nolonger had the strength to keep them company in those quietdays it was the little boy who the giant thought of the most     one day in the midst of a particularly bitter winter the giantglanced out his window and saw a truly miraculous sight thoughmost of the garden was covered in snow at the center of thegarden there stood a magnificent rosebush overflowing withspectacularly colored flowers next to the roses stood the little boywho the giant loved the boy was smiling sweetly the giantdanced with delight and rushed outside to embrace the childwhere have you been all these years my young friend ivemissed you with all my heart     the boy was thoughtful in his response many years ago youlifted me over the wall into your magical garden now i havecome to take you into mine later that day when the childrencame to visit the giant they found him lying lifeless on the groundfrom head to toe he was covered by a thousand beautiful roses    always be brave john like that little boy stand your groundand follow your dreams they will lead you to your destiny followyour destiny it will lead you into the wonders of the universe andalways follow the wonders of the universe for they will lead you toa special garden filled with roses    as i looked over at julian to tell him that this story hadtouched me deeply i saw something

my endurance as long as we have faith in our own     cause and an unconquerable will to win victory will     not be denied us                                           winston churchilljulian continued to use yogi ramans mystical fable as thecornerstone for the wisdom he was sharing with me i had learnedof the garden within my mind a storehouse of power andpotential through the symbol of the lighthouse i had learned ofthe overriding importance of a definite purpose in life and theeffectiveness of goalsetting by the example of the ninefoottallninehundredpound japanese sumo wrestler i had receivedinstruction on the timeless concept of kaizen and the bountifulbenefits that selfmastery would bring little did i know that thebest was still to come    you will recall that our friend the sumo wrestler was starknaked    except for the pink wire cable covering his private parts iinterjected gamely    right applauded julian the pink wire cable will serve toremind you of the power of selfcontrol and discipline in building aricher happier and more enlightened life my teachers in sivanawere undoubtedly the most healthy contented and serene people ihave ever met they were also the most disciplined these sagestaught me that the virtue of selfdiscipline was like a wire cablehave you ever really taken the time to study a wire cable john     it hasnt been high on my priority list i confessed with aquick grin     well have a look at one sometime you will see that it consistsof many thin tiny wires placed one on top of the other alone eachone is flimsy and weak but together their sum is much greaterthan their constituent parts and the cable becomes tougher thaniron selfcontrol and willpower are similar to this to build a willof iron it is essential to take small tiny acts in tribute to the virtueof personal discipline routinely performed the little acts pile oneon top of another to eventually produce an abundance of innerstrength perhaps the old african proverb says it best whenspider webs unite they tie up a lion when you liberate yourwillpower you become the master of your personal world whenyou continually practice the ancient art of selfgovernment therewill be no hurdle too high for you to overcome no challenge tootough for you to surmount and no crisis too hot for you to cooldown selfdiscipline will provide you with the mental reservesrequired to persevere when life throws you one of its little curves    i must also alert you to the fact that the lack of willpower is amental disease julian added surprisingly if you suffer from thisweakness make it a priority to stamp it out quickly an abundanceof willpower and discipline is one of the chief attributes of all thosewith strong characters and wonderful lives willpower allows youto do what you said you would do when you said you would do itit is willpower that allows you to get up at five in the morning tocultivate your mind through meditation or to feed your spirit by awalk in the woods when a cozy bed beckons you on a cold wintersday it is willpower that allows you to hold your tongue when a lessactualized person insults you or does something you disagree withit is willpower that pushes your dreams forward when the oddsappear to be insurmountable it is willpower that offers you theinner power to keep your commitments to others and perhapseven more importantly to yourself     is it really that important     most certainly my friend it is the essential virtue of everyperson who has created a life rich with passion possibility andpeace     julian then reached into his robe and pulled out a shiny silverlocket the kind you might see in a museum exhibit on ancientegypt     you shouldnt have i joked     the sages of sivana gave this gift to me on my last eveningwith them it was a joyous loving celebration between members ofa family who lived life to the fullest it was one of the greatest andsaddest nights of my life i didnt want to leave the nirvana ofsivana it was my sanctuary an oasis of all that was good in thisworld the sages had become my spiritual brothers and sisters ileft part of myself high in the himalayas that evening julian saidhis voice growing soft    what are the words engraved on the locket    here ill read them to you never forget them john theyhave really helped me when times got tough i pray that they alsobathe you in comfort during times of difficulty they say    through the steel of discipline you will forge a character   rich with courage and peace through the virtue of will   you are destined to rise to lifes highest ideal and live   within a heavenly mansion filled with all that is good   joyful and vital without them you are lost like a   mariner without a compass one who eventually sinks   with his ship    i have never really thought about the importance of selfcontrol although there have been many times ive wished i hadmore discipline i admitted are you saying that i can actuallybuild discipline the way my teenage son builds his biceps at thelocal gym    the analogy is an excellent one you condition yourwillpower just as your son conditions his body at the gymanyone no matter how weak or lethargic they might currentlybe can grow disciplined within a relatively short time mahatmagandhi is a good example when most people think of thismodernday saint they remember a man who could go weekswithout food in the pursuit of his cause and endure tremendouspain for the sake of his convictions but when you studygandhis life you will see that he was not always a master ofselfcontrol    youre not going to tell me that gandhi was a chocoholicare you     not quite john as a young lawyer in south africa he wasgiven to passionate outbursts and the disciplines of fasting andmeditation were as foreign to him as the simple white loinclothwhich eventually became his personal trademark in his later years     are you saying that with the right blend of training andpreparation i could have the same level of willpower as mahatmagandhi     everyone is different one of the fundamental principles thatyogi raman taught me was that truly enlightened people neverseek to be like others rather they seek to be superior to theirformer selves dont race against others race against yourselfjulian replied     when you have selfcontrol you will have the resolve to dothe things you have always wanted to do for you it may betraining for a marathon or mastering the art of whitewaterrafting or even giving up the law to become an artist whatever itis you are dreaming of whether it is material riches or spiritualriches i will not be your judge i will simply tell you that all thesethings will be within your grasp when you cultivate your sleepingreserves of willpower     julian added building selfcontrol and discipline into yourlife will also bring you a tremendous sense of freedom this alonewill change things     what do you mean     most people have liberty they can go where they want anddo the things they feel like doing but too many people are alsoslaves to their impulses they have grown reactive rather thanproactive meaning that they are like seafoam pounding against arocky shore going in whatever direction the tide might take themif they are spending time with their families and someone fromwork calls with a crisis they hit the ground running neverstopping to think which activity is more vital to their overall wellbeing and to their lifes purpose so after all i have observed inmy life both here in the west and in the east i say that suchpeople have liberty but lack freedom they lack a key ingredientto a meaningful enlightened life the freedom to see the forestbeyond the trees the freedom to choose what is right over whatseems pressing    i couldnt help but agree with julian sure i had little tocomplain about i had a great family a cozy home and a bustlinglaw practice but i really couldnt say that i had achieved freedommy pager was just as much an appendage as my right arm i wasalways on the run i never seemed to have the time tocommunicate deeply with jenny and quiet time for myself in theforeseeable future was about as likely as me winning the bostonmarathon the more i thought about it the more i realized that ihad probably never even tasted the nectar of true boundlessfreedom when i was younger i guess i really was a slave to myweaker impulses i always did what everyone else told me i shouldbe doing    and building willpower will offer me more freedom    freedom is like a house you build it brick by brick the firstbrick you should lay is willpower this quality inspires you to dowhat is right in any given moment it gives you the energy to actwith courage it gives you the control to live the life you haveimagined rather than accepting the life that you have    julian also noted the many practical benefits that thecultivation of discipline would bring    believe it or not developing the power of your will can erasethe worry habit keep you healthy and give you far more energythan you have ever had you see john selfcontrol is really nothingmore than mind control will is the king of mental powers whenyou master your mind you master your life mental mastery startswith being able to control every thought that you think when youhave developed the ability to discard all weak thoughts and focusonly on those that are positive and good positive and good actionswill follow soon you will start attracting all that is positive andgood into your life    heres an example lets say one of your personaldevelopment goals is to get up every morning at 600 am and gofor a run around that park behind your place lets pretend it isnow the middle of the winter and your alarm wakes you from adeep restful sleep your first impulse is to hit the snooze buttonand return to your slumber perhaps you will live up to yourexercise resolution tomorrow this pattern continues for a fewdays until you decide that you are too old to change your ways andthe physical fitness goal was too unrealistic    you know me too well i offered sincerely    now lets consider an alternative scenario it is still the deadof winter the alarm goes off and you start to think of staying inbed but instead of being a slave to your habits you challengethem with more powerful thoughts you start to picture in yourminds eye how you will look feel and act when you are in peakphysical shape you hear the many compliments your colleagues atthe office offer you as you saunter past them with a svelte trimphysique you focus on all that you can accomplish with theincreased energy a regular exercise program will bring no morenights spent in front of the television because you are too tired todo anything else after your long day in court your days are filledwith vitality enthusiasm and meaning     but say i do this and i still feel like going back to sleep ratherthan going running     initially for the first few days it will be a little difficult and youwill feel like going back to your old habits but yogi raman believedvery strongly in one timeless principle in particular positive alwaysovercomes negative so if you continue to wage war against theweaker thoughts that might have silently crept into the palace ofyour mind over the years eventually they will see that they areunwanted and leave like visitors who know they are not welcome     you mean to tell me that thoughts are physical things     yes and they are fully in your control it is just as easy tothink positive thoughts as it is to think negative ones     then why do so many people worry and focus on all thenegative information in our world     because they have not learned the art of selfcontrol anddisciplined thinking most people i have spoken to have no ideathat they have the power to control every single thought theythink every second of every minute of every day they believe thatthoughts just happen and have never realized that if you dont takethe time to start controlling your thoughts they will control youwhen you start to focus on good thoughts only and refuse to thinkthe bad ones through sheer willpower i promise you they willshrivel up very quickly     so if i want to have the inner strength to get up earlier eatless read more worry less be more patient or be more loving alli have to do is exert my will to cleanse my thoughts     when you control your thoughts you control your mindwhen you control your mind you control your life and once youreach the stage of being in total control of your life you becomethe master of your destiny     i needed to hear this through the course of this strange yetinspiring evening i had gone from being a skeptical litigatorcarefully studying a hotshot lawyerturned yogi to a believerwhose eyes had been opened for the first time in many years iwished jenny could hear all this actually i wished my kids couldhear this wisdom too i knew it would affect them as it had me ihad always planned on being a better family man and living morefully but i always found that i was too busy putting out all thoselittle brush fires of life that seemed so pressing maybe this was aweakness a lack of selfcontrol an inability to see the forest forthe trees perhaps life was passing by so quickly it seemed likejust yesterday that i was a young law student full of energy andenthusiasm i dreamed of becoming a political leader or even asupreme court judge back then but as time went by i settled intoa routine even as a cocky litigator julian used to tell me thatcomplacency kills the more i thought about it the more irealized that i had lost my hunger this wasnt a hunger for abigger house or a faster car this was a far deeper hunger ahunger for living with more meaning with more festivity and moresatisfaction     i started to daydream while julian continued to talk obliviousto what he was now saying i saw myself first as a fiftyyearoldand then as a sixtyyearoldman would i be stuck in the same jobwith the same people facing the same struggles at that point of mylife i dreaded that i had always wanted to contribute to the worldin some way and i sure wasnt doing it now i think it was at thatmoment with julian sitting next to me on my living room floor onthat sticky july night that i changed the japanese call it satorimeaning instant awakening and thats exactly what it was iresolved to fulfill my dreams and make my life far more than it hadever been that was my first taste of real freedom the freedomthat comes when you decide once and for all to take charge of yourlife and all its constituent elements     i will give you a formula for developing willpower saidjulian who had no idea of the inner transformation i had justexperienced wisdom without proper tools for its application isno wisdom at all     he continued every day while you are walking to work iwould like you to repeat a few simple words     is this one of those mantras you told me about earlier iasked     yes it is it is one that has been in existence for over fivethousand years although only the small band of sivanan monkshave known about it yogi raman told me that by its repetition iwould develop selfcontrol and an indomitable will within a shortperiod of time remember words are great influencers words arethe verbal embodiment of power by filling your mind with wordsof hope you become hopeful by filling your mind with words ofkindness you become kind by filling your mind with thoughts ofcourage you become courageous words have power julianobserved     okay im all ears     this is the mantra i suggest you repeat at least thirty timesa day i am more than i appear to be all the worlds strength andpower rests inside me it will manifest profound changes in yourlife for even quicker results blend this mantra with the practiceof creative envisioning i spoke of earlier for example go to a quietplace sit with your eyes closed do not let your mind wanderkeep your body still as the surest sign of a weak mind is a bodythat cannot rest now repeat the mantra aloud over and overagain while you do so see yourself as a disciplined firm personfully in control of your mind your body and your spirit pictureyourself acting as gandhi or mother teresa might act in achallenging situation startling results will surely come your wayhe promised     thats it i asked astonished by the apparent simplicity ofthis formula i can tap the full reserves of my willpower throughthis simple exercise     this technique has been taught by the spiritual teachers ofthe east for centuries it is still around today for one reasonbecause it works as always judge by results if you areinterested there are a couple of other exercises i can offer you toliberate the strength of your will and cultivate inner discipline butlet me warn you that they might seem strange at first     hey julian im absolutely fascinated by what ive beenhearing youre on a roll so dont stop now     okay the first thing is to start doing the things you dont likedoing for you it might be as simple as making your bed in themorning or walking rather than driving to work by getting intothe habit of exerting your will you will cease to be a slave to yourweaker impulses     use it or lose it     exactly to build willpower and inner strength you must firstuse it the more you exert and nurture the embryo of selfdiscipline the more quickly it will mature and give you the resultsyou desire the second exercise is a favorite of yogi ramans heused to go an entire day without speaking except in response to adirect question     kind of like a vow of silence     actually thats exactly what it was john the tibetan monkswho popularized this practice believed that to hold ones tonguefor an extended period of time would have the effect of enhancingones discipline     but how     basically by keeping silent for a day you are conditioningyour will to do as you command it to do each time the urge tospeak arises you actively curb this impulse and remain quiet yousee your will does not have a mind of its own it waits for you togive it instructions that will spur it into action the more controlyou exert over it the more powerful it will become the problemis that most people dont use their willpower     why is that i asked     probably because most people believe they dont have anythey blame everyone and everything except themselves for thisapparent weakness those who have a vicious temper will tell youi cant help it my father was the same way those who worry toomuch will tell you its not my fault my job is too stressful thosewho sleep too much will say what can i do my body needs tenhours of sleep a night such people lack the selfresponsibility thatcomes through knowing the extraordinary potential which liesdeep within every one of us waiting to be inspired into actionwhen you come to know the timeless laws of nature those thatgovern the operation of this universe and all that lives within ityou will also know that it is your birthright to be all that you canbe you have the power to be more than your environmentsimilarly you have the capacity to be more than a prisoner of yourpast to do this you must become the master of your will     sounds heavy     really its a very practical concept imagine what you coulddo if you doubled or tripled the amount of willpower that youcurrently have you could get into that exercise regimen you havedreamed of starting you could be far more efficient with yourtime you could erase the worry habit once and for all or you couldbe the ideal husband using your will allows you to rekindle thedrive and energy for living that you seem to be saying youve lostit is a very important area to focus on     so the bottom line is to start using my willpower on a regularbasis     yes decide to do the things you know you should be doingrather than walking the path of least resistance start to fight thegravitational force of your bad habits and weaker impulses just asa rocket rises above the force of gravity to enter the realm of theheavens push yourself just watch what will happen in a matter ofweeks     and the mantra will help     yes repeating the mantra i gave you along with the dailypractice of seeing yourself as you hope to be will give you anenormous amount of support as you create the disciplinedprincipled life that will connect you to your dreams and you neednot change your world in a day start off small the thousandmilejourney begins by taking that first step we grow great bydegrees even training yourself to get up an hour earlier andsticking to this wonderful habit will boost your selfconfidenceinspiring you to reach higher heights     i dont see the connection i admitted     small victories lead to large victories you must build on thesmall to achieve the great by following through on a resolution assimple as getting up earlier every day you will feel the pleasureand gratification that achievement brings you have set a goal andyou have realized it this feels good the trick is to keep settingthe mark higher and raising your standards continuously this willthen release that magical quality of momentum that will motivateyou to keep exploring your infinite potential do you like to skijulian questioned abruptly     i love skiing i replied jenny and i take the kids up to themountains whenever we can which isnt very often much to herdismay     okay just think of what its like when you push off from thetop of the ski hill at first you start off slowly but within a minuteyou are flying down the hill like theres no tomorrow right     just call me ninja skier i love the rush of speed     what gets you going so fast     my aerodynamically contoured physique i quipped     nice try julian laughed momentum is the answer imlooking for momentum is also the secret ingredient to buildingselfdiscipline like i said you start off small whether that meansgetting up a little earlier starting to walk around the block everynight or even just training yourself to turn off the television whenyou know you have had enough these small victories create themomentum that excites you to take larger steps along the path toyour highest self soon you are doing things that you never knewyou were capable of doing with a vigor and energy that you neverthought you had its a delightful process john it really is andthe pink wire cable in yogi ramans magical fable will alwaysremind you of the power of your will     just as julian finished revealing his thoughts on the subject ofdiscipline i noticed the first rays of the sun peeking into the livingroom pushing away the darkness like a child pushes away anunwanted bedcover this will be a great day i thought thefirst day of the rest of my lifechapter 10 action

to go about attaining it its usually too late that saying ifyouth only knew if age only could is so true    is that what the stopwatch in yogi ramans fable is all about    yes the naked ninefoottall ninehundredpound sumowrestler with the pink wire cable covering his private parts slips ona shiny gold stopwatch that someone has left in the beautifulgarden julian reminded me    how could i forget i replied breaking into a grin    by now i had realized that yogi ramans mystical fable wasnothing more than a series of memory pegs designed to teachjulian the elements of his ancient philosophy for enlightened livingwhile at the same time helping him remember it i shared mydiscovery with him     ah the sixth sense of a litigator you are quite right my wiseteachers methods appeared odd at first and i struggled tounderstand the significance of his tale just as you wondered what iwas speaking of when i first shared it with you but i must tell youjohn all seven elements of the story from the garden and thenaked sumo wrestler to the yellow roses and the path of diamondswhich i am soon getting to serve as powerful reminders of thewisdom i learned in sivana the garden keeps me focused oninspiring thoughts the lighthouse reminds me that the purpose oflife is a life of purpose the sumo wrestler keeps me centered oncontinuous selfdiscovery while the pink wire cable links me to thewonders of will power a day doesnt pass without me thinkingabout the fable and considering the principles yogi raman taughtme    and exactly what does the shiny gold stopwatch represent    it is a symbol of our most important commodity — time    what about positive thinking and goalgetting and selfmastery    they all mean nothing without time about six months after imade the delightful forest retreat in sivana my temporary homeone of the sages came to my hut of roses while i was studying hername was divea she was a stunningly beautiful woman with jetblack hair that fell just below her waist and in a very gentle andsweet voice she informed me that she was the youngest of all thesages living in that secret mountain abode she also said that shehad come to me on the instructions of yogi raman who had told herthat i was the best student he had ever had    maybe it is all the pain you suffered in your former life thathas allowed you to embrace our wisdom with such an open heartshe stated as the youngest of our community i have been askedto bring you a gift it is from all of us and we offer it as a token ofour respect for you one who has travelled so far to learn our waysat no point have you judged us or ridiculed our traditions sothough you have now decided to leave us within a few weeks weconsider you one of our own no outsider has ever received what iam about to give you    what was the gift i asked impatiently    divea pulled out an object from her homespun cotton bag andhanded it to me wrapped in a fragrant cover of some type of paperwas something i never thought id see there in a million years itwas a miniature hourglass which had been made from blown glassand a small piece of sandalwood seeing my expression diveaquickly told me that each of the sages had received one of theseinstruments as children though we have no possessions and livepure simple lives we respect time and note its passing these littlehourglasses serve as daily reminders of our mortality and theimportance of living full productive days while advancing ourpurposes    these monks up in the highest reaches of the himalayanmountains kept time    each and every one of them understood the importance oftime they each had developed what i call a time consciousnessyou see i learned that time slips through our hands like grains ofsand never to return those who use time wisely from an early ageare rewarded with rich productive and satisfying lives those whohave never been exposed to the principle that time mastery is lifemastery will never realize their enormous human potential timeis the great leveller whether we are privileged or disadvantagedwhether we live in texas or tokyo we all have been allotted dayswith only twentyfour hours what separates those who buildexceptional lives from the also rans is the way they use this time     i once heard my father say that it was the busiest people whohave time to spare what do you make of that     i agree busy productive people are highly efficient with theirtime — they must be in order to survive being an excellent timemanager doesnt mean that you must become a workaholic on thecontrary time mastery allows you more time to do the things youlove to do the things that are truly meaningful to you timemastery leads to life mastery guard time well remember its anonrenewable resource     let me give you an example julian offered lets say itsmonday morning and your schedule is overflowing withappointments meetings and court appearances rather thangetting up at your usual 630 am gulping down a cup of javaspeeding off to work and then spending a stressful day ofcatchup lets say you took fifteen minutes the night before toplan your day or to be even more effective lets say you took onehour on your quiet sunday morning to organize your entire weekin your daily planner you wrote out when you would meet withyour clients when you would do legal research and when youwould return phone calls most importantly your personal socialand spiritual development goals for the week also went into youragenda book this simple act is the secret to a life of balance byanchoring all the most vital aspects of your life into your dailyschedule you ensure that your week and your life retain a sense ofmeaning and peace     surely youre not suggesting that i take a break in the middleof my busy work day to walk in the park or meditate     i sure am why are you so rigidly bound to convention whydo you feel that you have to do things the same way as everyoneelse run your own race why not start working an hour earlierso that you will have the luxury of taking a serene midmorningwalk in that beautiful park across from your office or why notput in a few extra hours at the beginning of your week so that youcan cut out early on friday to take your kids to the zoo or whynot start working at home two days a week so that you can seemore of your family all im saying is plan your week and manageyour time creatively have the discipline to focus your time aroundyour priorities the most meaningful things in your life shouldnever be sacrificed to those that are the least meaningful andremember failing to plan is planning to fail by writing down notonly your appointments with others but also those allimportantappointments with yourself to read relax or write a love letter toyour wife you will be far more productive with your time neverforget that time spent enriching your nonwork hours is never awaste it makes you tremendously efficient during your workinghours stop living your life in compartments and understand onceand for all that all you do forms one indivisible whole the way youact at home affects the way you act at work the way you treatpeople at the office affects the way you will treat your family andfriends     i agree julian but i really dont have the time to take breaksin the middle of my day as it is i work most evenings my scheduleis really crushing these days as i said this i felt my stomachtingling at the mere thought of the mountain of work i was facing     being busy is no excuse the real question is what are you sobusy about one of the great rules i learned from that wise oldsage is that eighty percent of the results you achieve in your lifecome from only twenty percent of the activities that occupy yourtime yogi raman called it the ancient rule of twenty     im not sure i follow you     okay lets go back to your busy monday from morning untilnight you might spend your time doing everything from chattingon the phone with clients and drafting legal pleadings to readingyour youngest child a bedtime story or playing chess with yourwife agreed     agreed     but out of all of the hundreds of activities you give your timeto only twenty percent of those will yield real lasting results onlytwenty percent of what you do will have an influence on the qualityof your life these are your highimpact activities for exampleten years from now do you really think all the time you spentgossiping at the water cooler or sitting in some smokefilled lunchroom or watching television will count for anything     no not really     right so im sure you will also agree there are a number ofactivities that will count for everything     you mean like time spent improving my legal knowledge timespent enriching my relationships with my clients and time investedin becoming a more efficient lawyer     yes and time spent nourishing your relationship with jennyand the kids time spent connecting with nature and showinggratitude for all that you are so fortunate to have time spentrenewing your mind your body and your spirit these are just afew of the highimpact activities that will allow you to design the lifeyou deserve direct all of your time to those activities that countenlightened people are priority driven this is the secret of timemastery     wow yogi raman taught you all that     i have become a student of life john yogi raman certainlywas a wonderful and inspiring teacher and i will never forget himfor that but all of the lessons i have learned from my variedexperiences have now come together like pieces of a big jigsawpuzzle to show me the way to a better life     julian added i hope you will learn from my earlier mistakessome people learn from the errors others have made they are thewise others feel that true learning comes only from personalexperience such people endure needless pain and distress overthe course of their lives     i had been to many seminars on time management as a lawyeryet i had never heard the philosophy of time mastery that julianwas now sharing with me time management was not justsomething to focus on at the office and discard at closing time itwas a holistic system that could make all areas of my life morebalanced and fulfilling if i applied it correctly i learned that byplanning my days and taking the time to ensure that i wasbalanced in the use of my time i would not only be far moreproductive — i would be far happier     so life is like a fat strip of bacon i chimed in you have toseparate the meat from the fat in order to be the master of yourtime     very good youre on to it now and though my vegetarian sidetells me to do otherwise i love the analogy because it hits the nailright on the head when you spend your time and precious mentalenergy focusing on the meat you have no time to waste on the fatthis is the point at which your life moves from the realm of theordinary into the exquisiteness of the extraordinary this is whenyou really start to make things happen and the doors to the templeof enlightenment suddenly swing open julian observed    that brings me to another point dont let others steal yourtime be wary of time thieves these are the people who always callon the telephone just as you have put the kids to sleep and havesettled into your favorite chair to read that thrilling novel you haveheard so much about these are the people who have a knack ofdropping by your office just as you have found a few minutes in themidst of a hectic day to catch your breath and collect yourthoughts does this sound familiar     as usual julian youre right on the money i guess i havealways been too polite to ask them to leave or to keep my doorshut i confided     you must be ruthless with your time learn to say no havingthe courage to say no to the little things in life will give you thepower to say yes to the big things shut the door to your officewhen you need a few hours to work on that big case rememberwhat i told you dont pick up the phone every time it rings it isthere for your convenience not the convenience of othersironically people will respect you more when they see that you area person who values his time they will realize that your time isprecious and they will value it     what about procrastination all too often i keep putting offthe things that i dont like doing and instead find myself siftingthrough junk mail or flipping though legal magazines maybe imjust killing time     killing time is an apt metaphor true it is human nature todo things that feel good and avoid the things that feel bad but as isaid earlier the most productive people in this world havecultivated the habit of doing the things that less productive peopledont like doing even though they too might not like doing them     i stopped and thought deeply about the principle i had justheard perhaps procrastination was not my problem maybe mylife had simply become too complex julian sensed my concern     yogi raman told me that those who are masters of their timelive simple lives a hurried frenzied pace is not what natureintended while he firmly believed that lasting happiness could bereached only by those who were effective and set definite aims forthemselves living a life rich with accomplishment and contributiondid not have to come through the sacrifice of peace of mind this iswhat i found so fascinating about the wisdom i was hearing itallowed me to be productive and yet fulfill my spiritual longings    i started to open myself even more to julian you have alwaysbeen honest and forthright with me so i will be the same with youi dont want to give up my practice and my house and my car to behappier and more satisfied i like my toys and the material thingsi have earned they are my rewards for all the hours i haveworked over the years since we first met but i feel empty — ireally do i told you about my dreams when i was in law schoolthere is so much more i could do with my life you know im almostforty and i have never been to the grand canyon or the eiffeltower ive never walked in a desert or canoed across a still lake ona gorgeous summers day i have never once taken off my socksand shoes and walked barefoot through a park listening to the kidslaugh and the dogs bark i cant even remember the last time i tooka long quiet walk by myself after a snowfall just to hear the soundsand to enjoy the sensations   then simplify your life julian suggested sympatheticallyapply the ancient ritual of simplicity to every aspect of yourworld by doing so you are bound to have more time to savor theseglorious wonders one of the most tragic things that any one of uscan do is to put off living too many people are dreaming of somemagical rose garden on the horizon rather than enjoying the onegrowing in our back yards what a tragedy    any suggestions    that i will leave to your own imagination i have shared manyof the strategies i learned from the sages with you they will workwonders if you have the courage to apply them oh that remindsme of another thing that i do to make sure my life stays calm andsimple    whats that    i love to have a quick nap in the afternoon i find it keeps meenergetic refreshed and youthful i guess you could say that i needmy beauty sleep julian laughed    beauty has never been one of your strong points    a sense of humor has always been one of yours and for this icommend you always remember the power of laughter likemusic it is a wonderful tonic for lifes stresses and strains i thinkyogi raman said it best when he said laughter opens your heartand soothes your soul no one should ever take life so seriously thatthey forget to laugh at themselves    julian had one final thought to share on the subject of timeperhaps most importantly john stop acting like you have fivehundred years to live when divea brought that little hourglass tome she offered some advice that i will never forget    what did she say    she told me that the best time to plant a tree was forty yearsago the second best time is today dont waste even one minute ofyour day develop a deathbed mentality     i beg your pardon i asked struck by the graphic termjulian had employed whats a deathbed mentality     it is a new way of looking at your life a more empoweringparadigm if you will one that reminds you that today could be yourlast so savor it to the fullest     sounds kind of morbid if you ask me it makes me thinkabout death     actually its a philosophy about life when you adopt adeathbed mentality you live every day as if it was your lastimagine waking up every day and asking yourself the simplequestion what would i do today if it was my last then thinkabout how you would treat your family your colleagues and eventhose who you dont know think about how productive and excitedyou would be to live every moment to the maximum the deathbedquestion alone has the power to change your life it will energizeyour days and bring a rush of zest and spirit to all that you do youwill start focusing on all the meaningful things that you have beenputting off and stop squandering time on all those petty thingsthat have dragged you down into the quagmire of crisis and chaos    julian continued push yourself to do more and to experiencemore harness your energy to start expanding your dreams yesexpand your dreams dont accept a life of mediocrity when youhold such infinite potential within the fortress of your mind dareto tap into your greatness this is your birthright     powerful stuff     heres more there is a simple remedy to break the spell offrustration that plagues so many people     my cup is still empty i said softly     act as if failure is impossible and your success will be assuredwipe out every thought of not achieving your objectives whetherthey are material or spiritual be brave and set no limits on theworkings of your imagination never be a prisoner of your pastbecome the architect of your future you will never be the same    as the city started to awaken and the morning grew into fullbloom my ageless friend started to show the first signs ofweariness after a night spent sharing his knowledge with an eagerstudent i had been astonished by julians stamina his boundlessenergy and his endless enthusiasm he not only talked his talk —he walked his walk    we are moving to the end of yogi ramans magical fable andapproaching the time when i must leave you he said gently ihave much to do and many more people to meet    are you going to tell your partners that you have returnedhome i asked my curiosity getting the better of me    probably not julian replied i am so different from thejulian mantle they knew i dont think the same thoughts i dontwear the same clothes i dont do the same things i am afundamentally changed person they wouldnt recognize me    you really are a new man i agreed chuckling inwardly as ipictured this mystical monk adorned in the traditional robes ofsivana stepping into the striking red ferrari of his former life    a new being is probably even more accurate    i dont see the distinction i confessed    there is an ancient saying in india we are not human beingshaving a spiritual experience we are spiritual beings having ahuman experience i now understand my role in the universe i seewhat i am im no longer in the world the world is in me    im going to have to chew on that one for a while i said intotal honesty not quite comprehending what julian was talkingabout     sure i understand my friend a time will come when you areclear on what i am saying if you follow the principles i haverevealed to you and apply the techniques i have offered you willsurely advance along the path of enlightenment you will come tomaster the art of personal government you will see your life forwhat it really is a small blip on the canvas of eternity and you willcome to see clearly who you are and the ultimate purpose of yourlife     which is     to serve of course no matter how big a house you have orhow slick a car you drive the only thing you can take with you atthe end of your life is your conscience listen to your consciencelet it guide you it knows what is right it will tell you that yourcalling in life is ultimately selfless service to others in some form oranother this is what my personal odyssey has taught me now ihave so many others to see serve and heal my mission is to spreadthe ancient wisdom of the sages of sivana to all those who need tohear it this is my purpose     the fire of knowledge had kindled julians spirit — this wasobvious even to an unenlightened soul

young adoniswas not brought about by a simple change in his diet and a dailydose of some quickfix exercise plan no it was a far deeperpanacea that julian had stumbled upon high in those

william blakethe sages of sivana were not only the most youthful people ihave ever met observed julian they were also without a doubtthe kindest     yogi raman told me that when he was a child as he waitedfor sleep his father would step softly into his rosecovered hut andask him what good deeds he had performed through the course ofthat day believe it or not if he said that he hadnt done any hisfather would request that he get up and perform some act ofkindness and selfless service before he was permitted to go tosleep     julian went on one of the most essential of all of the virtuesfor enlightened living that i can share with you john is this onewhen all is said and done no matter what you have achieved nomatter how many summer homes you own no matter how manycars sit in your driveway the quality of your life will come down tothe quality of your contribution     does this have something to do with the fresh yellow roses inyogi ramans fable     of course it does the flowers will remind you of the ancientchinese proverb a little bit of fragrance always clings to the handthat gives you roses the meaning is clear — when you work toimprove the lives of others you indirectly elevate your own life inthe process when you take care to practice random acts ofkindness daily your own life becomes far richer and moremeaningful to cultivate the sacredness and sanctity of each dayserve others in some way     are you suggesting that i get involved in some volunteerwork     thats an excellent starting point but what im speaking of ismuch more philosophical than that im suggesting that you adopta new paradigm of your role on this planet     youre losing me again shed some light on the termparadigm im not really familiar with it     a paradigm is simply a way of looking at a circumstance or atlife in general some people see the glass of life as half empty theoptimists see it as half full they interpret the same circumstancedifferently because they have adopted a different paradigm aparadigm is basically the lens through which you see the events ofyour life both external and internal     so when you suggest that i adopt a new paradigm of mypurpose are you saying that i should change my outlook     sort of to dramatically improve the quality of your life youmust cultivate a new perspective of why you are here on earthyou must realize that just as you entered the world with nothingyou are destined to leave with nothing this being the case therecan be only one real reason for your being here    and that would be    to give yourself to others and to contribute in a meaningfulway julian replied im not saying that you cant have your toysor that you must give up your law practice and devote your life tothe disadvantaged although i have recently met people who havetaken this course of action with great satisfaction our world is inthe midst of great change people are trading in money formeaning lawyers who used to judge people by the size of theirpocketbooks are now judging people by the size of theircommitment to others by the size of their hearts teachers areleaving the wombs of their secure jobs to nurture the intellectualgrowth of needy kids living in the combat zones we call inner citiespeople have heard the clear call for change people are realizingthat they are here for a purpose and that they have been givenspecial gifts that will aid them to realize it    what kind of special gifts    exactly the ones i have been telling you about all evening anabundance of mental ability boundless energy unlimitedcreativity a storehouse of discipline and a wellspring ofpeacefulness it is simply a matter of unlocking these treasuresand applying them for some common good noted julian    im still with you so how can one go about doing good    im simply saying that you should make it a priority tochange your world view so that you stop seeing yourself purely asan individual and start seeing yourself as part of the collective    so i should become kinder and gentler     realize that the most noble thing you can do is to give toothers the sages of the east call it the process of shedding theshackles of self it is all about losing your selfconsciousness andstarting to focus on a higher purpose this might be in the form ofgiving more to those around you whether this means your time oryour energy these truly are your two most valuable resources itcould be something as major as taking a oneyear sabbatical towork with the poor or something as minor as letting a few carspass in front of you in the middle of a crushing traffic jam it mightsound corny but if there is one thing that i have learned it is thatyour life moves to a more magical dimension when you startstriving to make the world a better place yogi raman said thatwhen we are born we are crying while the world rejoices hesuggested that we should live our lives in such a way that when wedie the world cries while we are rejoicing    i knew julian had a point one of the things that was startingto bother me about practicing law was that i didnt really feel i wasmaking the sort of contribution i knew i was capable of makingsure i had the privilege of litigating a number of precedentsettingcases that had advanced a number of good causes but law hadbecome a business for me rather than a labor of love i was anidealist in law school like so many of my contemporaries over coldcoffee and stale pizza in our dorm rooms we had planned tochange the world almost twenty years have passed since thenand my burning desire to advocate change has given way to myburning desire to pay off my mortgage and build up my retirementfund i realized for the first time in a long while that i hadensconced myself in a middleclass cocoon one that sheltered mefrom society at large and one i had grown accustomed to    let me share an old story with you that might really hithome julian continued there was once a feeble old womanwhose loving husband died so she went to live with her son andhis wife and daughter every day the womans sight grew worseand her hearing grew worse some days her hands trembled sobadly the peas on her plate rolled onto the floor and the soup ranfrom her cup her son and his wife couldnt help but be annoyed atthe mess she made and one day they said enough was enough sothey set up a little table for the old woman in a corner next to thebroom closet and made her eat all of her meals there alone shewould look at them at mealtimes with tearfilled eyes from acrossthe room but they hardly talked to her while they ate except toscold her for dropping a spoon or a fork    one evening just before dinner the little girl was sitting onthe floor playing with her building blocks what are you makingher father asked earnestly im building a little table for you andmother she said so you can eat by yourselves in the cornersomeday when i get big the father and mother were moved tosilence for what seemed like an eternity then they started toweep in that instant they became aware of the nature of theiractions and the sadness they had caused that night they led theold woman back to her rightful place at their big dinner table andfrom that day on she ate all her meals with them and when a littlemorsel of food fell off the table or a fork strayed onto the floornobody seemed to mind anymore    in this story the parents were not bad people julian saidthey simply needed the spark of awareness to light their candleof compassion compassion and daily acts of kindness make life farricher take the time to meditate every morning on the good youwill do for others during your day the sincere words of praise tothose who least expect it the gestures of warmth offered tofriends in need the small tokens of affection to members of yourfamily for no reason at all all add up to a much more wonderfulway to live and speaking of friendships make sure you keep themin constant repair a person with three solid friends is verywealthy indeed    i nodded    friends add humor fascination and beauty to life there arefew things more rejuvenating than sharing a bellybursting laughwith an old friend friends keep you humble when you get too selfrighteous friends make you smile when you are taking yourselftoo seriously good friends are there to help you when life throwsone of its little curves at you and things look worse than they seemwhen i was a busy litigator i had no time for friends now i amalone except for you john i have no one to take long walks in thewoods with when everyone else is nestled into the cocoon of a softhazy slumber when i have just put down a wonderful book thathas moved me deeply i have no one to share my thoughts withand i have no one to open my soul to when the sunshine of aglorious autumn day warms my heart and fills me with joy    julian quickly caught himself however regret is not anactivity for which i have any time i have learned from myteachers in sivana that every dawn is a new day to the one whois enlightened    i had always viewed julian as a sort of superhuman legalgladiator crunching through the arguments of his opponents as amartial artist does through a stack of heavily reinforced boards icould see that the man i had met many years ago had beentransformed into one of a very different nature the one in front ofme was gentle kind and peaceful he seemed secure in who he wasand in his role in the theatre of life like no other person i had evermet he seemed to see the pain of his past as a wise old teacherand yet at the same time he served notice that his life was farmore than the sum of events gone by    julians eyes glittered in the hope of things yet to come i wasenveloped by his sense of delight for the wonders of this world andcaught up in his unbridled joy for living it appeared to me thatjulian mantle hardhitting bonecrunching litigation counsel tothe wellheeled had indeed been elevated from a human beingpassing through life without a care for anyone to a spiritual beingpassing through life caring only about others perhaps this was thepath that i too was about to walkchapter 12 action

my soul expands in worship of the creator                                           mahatma gandhiit had been over twelve hours since julian had arrived at myhouse the night before to share the wisdom he had gathered insivana those twelve hours were without a doubt the mostimportant of my life all at once i was feeling exhilaratedmotivated and yes even liberated julian had fundamentallychanged my outlook on life with yogi ramans fable and theageless virtues that it represented i realized that i had not evenbegun to explore the reaches of my human potential i had beensquandering the daily gifts that life had thrown my way julianswisdom had allowed me the opportunity to come to grips with thewounds that were keeping me from living with the laughterenergy and fulfillment i knew that i deserved i felt moved    ill have to leave soon you have commitments which arepressing on your time and i have my own work to tend to juliansaid apologetically    my work can wait    unfortunately mine cant he said with a quick smile    but before i leave i must reveal the final element of yogiramans magical fable you will recall that the sumo wrestler whowalked out of the lighthouse in the middle of a beautiful gardenwith nothing more than a pink wire cable covering his privateparts slipped on a shiny gold stopwatch and fell to the groundafter what seemed like an eternity he finally regainedconsciousness when the marvellous fragrance of the yellow rosesreached his nose he then jumped to his feet in delight and wasastonished to see a long winding path studded with millions of tinydiamonds of course our friend the sumo wrestler took the pathand in doing so lived happily ever after     seems plausible i chuckled     yogi raman had quite a vivid imagination ill agree but youhave seen that his story has a purpose and that the principles itsymbolizes are not only powerful — they are highly practical     true i agreed without reservation     the path of diamonds then will serve to remind you of thefinal virtue for enlightened living by carrying this principle withyou through your daily work you will enrich your life in a way thatis difficult for me to describe you will begin to see the exquisitewonders in the simplest of things and live with the ecstacy youdeserve and by carrying out your promise to me and sharing itwith others you will also allow them to transform their world fromthe ordinary into the extraordinary     will this take me a while to learn     the principle itself is strikingly straightforward to graspbut learning how to apply it effectively in all your wakingmoments will take a couple of weeks of steady practice     okay im dying to hear it     funny you say that because the seventh and final virtue is allabout living the sages of sivana believed that a truly joyful andrewarding life comes only through a process they called living inthe now these yogis knew that the past is water under the bridgeand the future is a distant sun on the horizon of your imaginationthe most important moment is now learn to live in it and savor itfully    i understand exactly what you are saying julian i seem tospend most of my day fretting over past events that i have nopower to change or worrying about things to come which never doarrive my mind is always flooded by a million little thoughtspulling me in a million different directions its really frustrating     why     it tires me out i guess i just dont have peace of mind yet ihave experienced times when my mind is fully occupied on onlywhat was in front of me often this happened when i was underthe gun to crank out a legal brief and i didnt have time to thinkabout anything other than the task at hand ive also felt this kindof total focus when i was playing soccer with the boys and i reallywanted to win hours seemed to pass by in minutes and i feltcentered it was as if the only thing that mattered to me was whati was doing in that very moment everything else the worries thebills the law practice didnt count come to think of it these wereprobably the times when i felt the most peaceful as well     being engaged in a pursuit that truly challenges you is thesurest route to personal satisfaction but the real key to rememberis that happiness is a journey not a destination live for today —there will never be another one quite like it stated julian hissmooth hands coming together as if to give a prayer of thanks forbeing privy to what he had just said    is that the principle that the path of diamonds in yogiramans fable symbolizes i asked    yes came the succinct reply just as the sumo wrestlerfound lasting fulfillment and joy by walking the path of diamondsyou can have the life you deserve the very moment you start tounderstand that the path you are currently walking on is one richwith diamonds and other priceless treasures stop spending somuch time chasing lifes big pleasures while you neglect the littleones slow things down enjoy the beauty and sacredness of allthat is around you you owe this to yourself     does that mean that i should stop setting big goals for myfuture and concentrate on the present     no replied julian firmly as i said earlier goals and dreamsfor the future are essential elements in every truly successful lifehope for what will appear in your future is what gets you out ofbed in the morning and what keeps you inspired through yourdays goals energize your life my point is simply this never putoff happiness for the sake of achievement never put off the thingsthat are important for your wellbeing and satisfaction to a latertime today is the day to live fully not when you win the lottery orwhen you retire never put off living     julian stood up and started pacing back and forth across theliving room floor like a seasoned litigator releasing his final kernelsof reason in an impassioned closing argument dont fool yourselfinto thinking that you will be a more loving and giving husbandwhen your law firm takes on a few more junior lawyers to ease theburden dont kid yourself into believing that you will start toenrich your mind care for your body and nourish your soul whenyour bank account gets big enough and you have the luxury ofmore free time today is the day to enjoy the fruits of your effortstoday is the day to seize the moment and live a life that soarstoday is the day to live from your imagination and harvest yourdreams and please never ever forget the gift of family    im not sure i know exactly what you mean julian    live your childrens childhood came the simple reply    huh i muttered perplexed at the apparent paradox    few things are as meaningful as being a part of yourchildrens childhood what is the point of climbing the steps ofsuccess if you have missed the first steps of your own kids whatgood is owning the biggest house on your block if you have nottaken the time to create a home what is the use of being knownacross the country as a redhot trial lawyer if your kids dont evenknow their father julian offered his voice now quivering withemotion i know whereof i speak    this last comment floored me all i knew of julian was that hehad been a superstar litigator who hung out with the rich and thebeautiful his romantic trysts with nubile fashion models werealmost as legendary as his courtroom skills what could thisformer millionaire playboy possibly know about being a fatherwhat could he possibly know about the daily struggles i faced intrying to be all things to all people a great father and a successfullawyer but julians sixth sense caught me    i do know something of the blessings we call children hesaid softly      but i always thought you were the citys most eligiblebachelor before you threw in the towel and gave up your practice      before i was caught up in the illusion of that fast and furiouslifestyle that i was so well known for you know that i was married      yes      he then paused as a child might before telling his best friend acloselyguarded secret what you do not know is that i also had alittle daughter she was the sweetest most delicate creature i haveever seen in my life back then i was a lot like you were the firsttime we met cocky ambitious and full of hope i had everythinganyone could ever want people told me i had a brilliant future astunningly beautiful wife and a wonderful daughter yet when lifeseemed to be perfect it was all taken from me in an instant    for the first time since his return julians eternally joyful facewas enveloped in sadness a single tear began to slide down one ofhis bronzed cheeks and dripped onto the velvety fabric of his rubyred robe i was speechless and gripped by the revelation of mylongtime friend    you dont have to continue julian i offered sympatheticallyplacing an arm around his shoulder to comfort him    but i do john of all those i knew in my former life youshowed the most promise as i said you reminded me a lot ofmyself when i was younger even now you still have so much goingfor you but if you keep on living the way youre living you areheaded for disaster i came back to this place to show you thatthere are so many wonders waiting for you to explore so manymoments left for you to savor    the drunk driver who killed my daughter didnt take awayonly one precious life on that sunsoaked october afternoon — hetook two after my daughters passing my life unravelled istarted spending every waking minute at the office foolishlyhoping that my legal career might be the salve for the pain of abroken heart somedays i even slept on a couch in my officedreading to return to the home where so many sweet memorieshad been laid to rest and while my career did take off my innerworld was a mess my wife who had been my constant companionsince law school left me citing my obsession with my work as thestraw that broke the proverbial camels back my healthdeteriorated and i spiralled into the infamous life that i wasengaged in when we first met sure i had everything money couldpossibly buy but i sold my soul for it i really did julian notedemotionally his voice still choked up    so when you say live your childrens childhood you arebasically telling me to take the time to watch them grow andflourish thats it isnt it    even today twentyseven years after she left us while wewere driving her to her best friends birthday party i would giveanything just to hear my daughter giggle again or to play hideandseek like we used to in our back garden i would love to holdher in my arms and softly caress her golden hair she took a pieceof my heart with her when she left and though my life has beeninspired by new meaning since i found the way to enlightenmentand selfleadership in sivana a day doesnt pass without me seeingthe rosy face of my sweet little girl in the silent theatre of mymind you have such great kids john dont miss the forest for thetrees the best gift you could ever give your children is your loveget to know them again show them that they are far moreimportant to you than the fleeting rewards of your professionalcareer pretty soon they will be off building lives and families oftheir own then it will be too late the time will be gone    julian had struck a chord deep inside of me i guess i hadknown for some time that my workaholic pace was slowly butsteadily loosening our familys ties but it was like a smolderingember burning quietly slowly gathering its energy beforerevealing the full extent of its destructive potential i knew mykids needed me even if they might not have told me so i neededto hear this from julian time was slipping by and they weregrowing up so quickly i couldnt remember the last time my sonandy and i had stolen off early on a crisp saturday morning tospend the day at the fishing hole his grandfather loved so muchthere was a time when we would go every weekend now thistimehonored ritual seemed like someone elses memory    the more i thought about it the harder it hit me pianorecitals christmas plays littleleague championships had all beentraded for my professional advancement    what was i doing i wondered i really was sliding down theslippery slope that julian described there and then i resolved tochange    happiness is a journey julian continued his voice risingonce again with the heat of passion it is also a choice that youmake you can marvel at the diamonds along the way or you cankeep running through all your days chasing that elusive pot ofgold at the end of the rainbow that ultimately reveals itself to beempty enjoy the special moments that every day offers becausetoday this day is all you have    can anyone learn to live in the now    absolutely no matter what your current circumstancesmight be you can train yourself to enjoy the gift of living and fillyour existence with the jewels of everyday life    but isnt that a little optimistic how about someone who hasjust lost everything they own due to a bad business deal lets saythat not only are they financially bankrupt but emotionallybankrupt as well     the size of your bank account and the size of your house havenothing to do with living life with a sense of joy and wonder thisworld is full of unhappy millionaires do you think the sages i metin sivana were concerned with having a wellbalanced financialportfolio and acquiring a summer home in the south of francejulian asked mischievously     okay i see your point     there is a huge difference between making a lot of moneyand making a lot of life when you start spending even fiveminutes a day practicing the art of gratitude you will cultivate therichness of living that you are looking for even the person youspoke of in your example can find an abundance of things to bethankful for notwithstanding his dire financial predicament askhim if he still has his health his loving family and his goodreputation in the community question him as to whether he ishappy to have citizenship in this great country and whether he stillhas a roof over his head perhaps he might have no assets otherthan a masterful ability to work hard and the ability to dream bigdreams yet these are precious assets for which he ought to begrateful we all have much to be thankful for even the birdssinging outside your windowsill on what looks like anothermagnificent summers day appear as a gift to the wise personremember john life doesnt always give you what you ask for butit always gives you what you need     so by giving daily thanks for all of my assets whether theseare material or spiritual i will develop the habit of living in themoment    yes this is an effective method for putting far more livinginto your life when you savor the now you kindle the fire of lifethat allows you to grow your destiny    grow my destiny    yes i told you earlier that we all have been given certaintalents every single person on the planet is a genius    you dont know some of the lawyers i work with i quipped    everyone said julian emphatically we all have somethingthat we are meant to do your genius will shine through andhappiness will fill your life the instant you discover your higherpurpose and then direct all your energies towards it once you areconnected to this mission whether it is being a great teacher ofchildren or an inspired artist all your desires will be fulfilledeffortlessly you will not even have to try as a matter of fact theharder you try the longer it will take you to reach your aimsinstead simply follow the path of your dreams in full expectationof the bounty that is certain to flow this will bring you to yourdivine destination this is what i mean by growing your destinyjulian offered sagely     when i was a young boy my father loved to read me a fairytale known as peter and the magic thread peter was a very livelylittle boy everyone loved him his family his teachers and hisfriends but he did have one weakness     what was that     peter could never live in the moment he had not learned toenjoy the process of life when he was in school he dreamed ofbeing outside playing when he was outside playing he dreamed ofhis summer vacation peter constantly daydreamed never takingthe time to savor the special moments that filled his days onemorning peter was out walking in a forest near his home feelingtired he decided to rest on a patch of grass and eventually dozedoff after only a few minutes of deep sleep he heard someonecalling his name peter peter came the shrill voice from aboveas he slowly opened his eyes he was startled to see a strikingwoman standing above him she must have been over a hundredyears old and her snowwhite hair dangled well below hershoulders like a matted blanket of wool in this womans wrinkledhand was a magical little ball with a hole in the center and out ofthe hole dangled a long golden thread    peter she said this is the thread of your life if you pull thethread just a bit an hour will pass in seconds if you pull a littleharder whole days will pass in minutes and if you pull with allyour might months — even years — will pass by in days petergrew very excited at this discovery id like to have it if i may heasked the elderly woman quickly reached down and gave the ballwith the magic thread to the young boy    the next day peter was sitting in the classroom feelingrestless and bored suddenly he remembered his new toy as hepulled a little bit of the golden thread he quickly found himself athome playing in his garden realizing the power of the magicthread peter soon grew tired of being a schoolboy and longed tobe a teenager with all the excitement that phase of life wouldbring so again he pulled out the ball and pulled hard on the goldenthread     suddenly he was a teenager with a very pretty younggirlfriend named elise but peter still wasnt content he hadnever learned to enjoy the moment and to explore the simplewonders of every stage of his life instead he dreamed of being anadult so again he pulled on the thread and many years whizzed byin an instant now he found that he had been transformed into amiddleaged adult elise was now his wife and peter wassurrounded with a houseful of kids but peter also noticedsomething else his once jet black hair had started to turn greyand his once youthful mother whom he loved so dearly had grownold and frail yet peter still could not live in the moment he hadnever learned to live in the now so once again he pulled on themagic thread and waited for the changes to appear     peter now found that he was a ninetyyearold man his thickdark hair had turned white as snow and his beautiful young wifeelise had also grown old and had passed away a few years earlierhis wonderful children had grown up and left home to lead livesof their own for the first time in his entire life peter realized thathe had not taken the time to embrace the wonders of living hehad never gone fishing with his kids or taken a moonlight strollwith elise he had never planted a garden or read thosewonderful books his mother had loved to read instead he hadhurried through life never resting to see all that was good alongthe way     peter became very sad at this discovery he decided to go outto the forest where he used to walk as a boy to clear his head andwarm his spirit as he entered the forest he noticed that the littlesaplings of his childhood had grown into mighty oaks the forestitself had matured into a paradise of nature he lay down on asmall patch of grass and fell into a deep slumber after only aminute he heard someone calling out to him peter peter criedthe voice he looked up in astonishment to see that it was noneother than the old woman who had given him the ball with themagic golden thread many years earlier    how have you enjoyed my special gift she asked    peter was direct in his reply     at first it was fun but now i hate it my whole life has passedbefore my eyes without giving me the chance to enjoy it surethere would have been sad times as well as great times but ihavent had the chance to experience either i feel empty inside ihave missed the gift of living     you are very ungrateful said the old woman still i will giveyou one last wish     peter thought for an instant and then answered hastily idlike to go back to being a schoolboy and live my life over again hethen returned to his deep sleep    again he heard someone calling his name and opened his eyeswho could it be this time he wondered when he opened hiseyes he was absolutely delighted to see his mother standing overhis bedside she looked young healthy and radiant peter realizedthat the strange woman of the forest had indeed granted his wishand he had returned to his former life     hurry up peter you sleep too much your dreams will makeyou late for school if you dont get up right this minute his motheradmonished needless to say peter dashed out of bed on thismorning and began to live the way he had hoped peter went on tolive a full life one rich with many delights joys and triumphs butit all started when he stopped sacrificing the present for the futureand began to live in the moment     amazing story i said softly     unfortunately john the story of peter and the magic threadis just that a story a fairy tale we here in the real world will neverget a second chance to live life to the fullest today is your chanceto awaken to the gift of living — before it is too late time reallydoes slip through your fingers like tiny grains of sand let thisnew day be the defining moment of your life the day that youmake the decision once and for all

 the sages of sivana believed that the ultimate destination ofall truly enlightened souls was a place called nirvana actuallymore than a place the sages believed nirvana to be a state onethat transcended anything they had known previously in nirvanaall things were possible there was no suffering and the dance oflife was played out with divine perfection on reaching nirvanathe sages felt that they would step into heaven on earth this wastheir ultimate goal in life julian observed his face radiating apeaceful almost angelic quality    we are all here for some special reason he

and improve thequality of their lives just as you will improve the quality of yoursand remember the journey is to be enjoyed the road is just asgood as the end     i let julian continue yogi raman was a great storyteller butthere was one story he told me which stood out amongst the restmay i share it with you     absolutely     many years ago in ancient india a maharajah wanted tobuild a great tribute to his wife as a sign of his deep love andaffection for her this man wanted to create a structure thelikes of which the world had never seen one that would shimmeracross the moonlit sky one that people would admire for centuriesto come so every day block by block his workers toiled in the hotsun every day this structure started to look a little more defineda little more like a monument a little more like a beacon of loveagainst the azure blue indian sky finally after twentytwo yearsof daily gradual progress this palace of pure marble wascomplete guess what im speaking of     i have no idea     the taj mahal one of the seven wonders of the worldjulian replied my point is simple everyone on this planet is awonder of this world every one of us is a hero in some way oranother every one
